abstract: "With trl you can train transformer language models with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The library is built on top of the transformers library by \U0001F917 Hugging Face. Therefore, pre-trained language models can be directly loaded via transformers. At this point, most decoder and encoder-decoder architectures are supported."
