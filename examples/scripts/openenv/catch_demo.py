"""
Simple demo script for the OpenSpiel Catch environment.

This demonstrates the basic workflow:
1. Start the environment server
2. Connect to it
3. Reset and observe initial state
4. Take actions and see rewards
5. Clean up

Setup:

```sh
uv pip install git+https://github.com/meta-pytorch/OpenEnv.git
uv pip install open_spiel
```

Usage:

```sh
python trl/experimental/openenv/catch_demo.py
```
