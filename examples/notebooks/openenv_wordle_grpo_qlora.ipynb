    "An **agentic environment** is a setting where a model can take actions, observe outcomes, and adjust its behavior based on feedback, similar to how humans learn from trial and error.\n",
    "In this case, the agent interacts with the **Wordle** environment through the [**OpenEnv**](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/OpenEnv) framework, which standardizes multi-agent and RL-style text environments.\n",

    "## GAME RULES\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The target is a 5-letter English word\n",
    "2. You have 6 attempts to guess the correct word\n",
    "3. After each guess, you receive color-coded feedback:\n",
    "   - GREEN: Letter is correct and in the correct position\n",
    "   - YELLOW: Letter is in the word but in the wrong position\n",
    "   - GRAY: Letter is not in the word at all\n",
    "4. All guesses must be valid 5-letter English words\n",
    "5. You cannot reuse a word you've already guessed\n",
    "\n",
    "## RESPONSE FORMAT\n",
    "\n",
    "Only respond with your next guess in square brackets, e.g., [crane].\n",
    "\n",
    "Format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[guess]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## STRATEGIC APPROACH\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not repeat the same guess twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening Strategy\n",
    "- Start with words rich in common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N)\n",
    "- Optimal starters: CRANE, SLATE, STARE, AROSE, IRATE\n",
    "- Prioritize words that test the most common letters in different positions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mid-Game Strategy\n",
    "- Use confirmed GREEN letters in their correct positions\n",
    "- Place YELLOW letters in different positions than where they appeared\n",
    "- Eliminate GRAY letters from consideration\n",
    "- If multiple letters are unknown, prioritize common letter combinations (TH, CH, ST, ER, etc.)\n",
    "- Consider letter frequency: E is most common, followed by A, R, I, O, T, N, S\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vowel Placement\n",
    "- Most 5-letter words have 2 vowels\n",
    "- Common patterns: vowel-consonant-vowel (like CRANE) or consonant-vowel-vowel-consonant-vowel (like QUEUE)\n",
    "- If you have 1-2 vowels confirmed, consider where the others might be\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Tactics\n",
    "- Use \"sacrificial\" guesses to test multiple new letters if you have attempts to spare\n",
    "- Avoid repeating letter patterns unless you're certain (e.g., SPEED has two E's)\n",
    "- Think about word endings: -ER, -LY, -ED, -ING are common but may not fit the 5-letter constraint\n",
    "- Consider less common letters (Q, X, Z, J) only when you've eliminated the most common options\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n",
    "- Don't reuse letters marked GRAY (eliminated letters)\n",
    "- Don't place YELLOW letters in the same position they appeared\n",
    "- Don't ignore confirmed GREEN letters in future guesses\n",
    "- Don't guess words that contradict known information\n",
    "\n",
    "## EXAMPLES\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Opening Guess\n",
    "\"Starting with a word that tests common vowels and consonants in varied positions.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "\"A is confirmed in position 2. R and E are in the word but need different positions. C and N are eliminated. I'll try a word with A in position 2, and test R and E in new positions along with common letters like S and T.\"\n",
    "[spare]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Narrowing Down\n",
    "Previous guesses: CRANE (C=gray, R=yellow, A=green, N=gray, E=yellow), SPARE (S=gray, P=gray, A=green, R=green, E=green)\n",
    "Feedback summary: _ARE_ with R in position 4, A in position 2, E in position 5\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I have _AR E_ confirmed. Positions 1 and 3 are unknown. Common letters to try: T, L, D, B, F, G. Testing with TARED.\"\n",
    "[tared]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 4: Final Deduction\n",
    "Previous feedback shows: _ARED with position 1 unknown and all common consonants tested\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Only position 1 remains. I've eliminated S, P, C, N. Common starting consonants left are B, F, G, H. BARED is a common word.\"\n",

    "## LETTER FREQUENCY REFERENCE\n",
    "\n",
    "Most common letters in 5-letter words (in order):\n",

    "## IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use lowercase only\n",
    "- One guess per response\n",
    "- Must be exactly 5 letters\n",
    "- Must be a real English word from standard dictionaries\n",
