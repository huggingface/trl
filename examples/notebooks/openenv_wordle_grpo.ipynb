        "- Start with words rich in common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (R, S, T, L, N)\n",
        "- Optimal starters: CRANE, SLATE, STARE, AROSE, IRATE\n",
        "- Prioritize words that test the most common letters in different positions\n",
        "\n",
        "### Mid-Game Strategy\n",
        "- Use confirmed GREEN letters in their correct positions\n",
        "- Place YELLOW letters in different positions than where they appeared\n",
        "- Eliminate GRAY letters from consideration\n",
        "- If multiple letters are unknown, prioritize common letter combinations (TH, CH, ST, ER, etc.)\n",
        "- Consider letter frequency: E is most common, followed by A, R, I, O, T, N, S\n",
        "\n",
        "### Vowel Placement\n",
        "- Most 5-letter words have 2 vowels\n",
        "- Common patterns: vowel-consonant-vowel (like CRANE) or consonant-vowel-vowel-consonant-vowel (like QUEUE)\n",
        "- If you have 1-2 vowels confirmed, consider where the others might be\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advanced Tactics\n",
        "- Use \"sacrificial\" guesses to test multiple new letters if you have attempts to spare\n",
        "- Avoid repeating letter patterns unless you're certain (e.g., SPEED has two E's)\n",
        "- Think about word endings: -ER, -LY, -ED, -ING are common but may not fit the 5-letter constraint\n",
        "- Consider less common letters (Q, X, Z, J) only when you've eliminated the most common options\n",
        "\n",
        "### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n",
        "- Don't reuse letters marked GRAY (eliminated letters)\n",
        "- Don't place YELLOW letters in the same position they appeared\n",
        "- Don't ignore confirmed GREEN letters in future guesses\n",
