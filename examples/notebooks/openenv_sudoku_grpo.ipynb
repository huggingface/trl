    "With [**Transformers Reinforcement Learning (TRL)**](https://github.com/huggingface/trl), you can train a model that learns to **play Sudoku**, through interaction and reinforcement.\n",

    "- [TRL GitHub Repository](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) — star us to support the project!  \n",

    "An **agentic environment** is a setting where a model can take actions, observe outcomes, and adjust its behavior based on feedback, similar to how humans learn from trial and error.\n",
    "In this case, the agent interacts with the **Sudoku** environment through the [**OpenEnv**](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/OpenEnv) framework, which standardizes multi-agent and RL-style text environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sudoku is a classic logic-based puzzle where the objective is to fill a **9×9 grid** so that. Each **row**, **column**, and **3×3 subgrid** contains all digits from **1 to 9** exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured yet challenging setup makes Sudoku an excellent benchmark for reasoning and decision-making tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll fine-tune a model using **GRPO** (Group Relative Policy Optimization) via TRL.\n",
    "The training loop follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The agent **generates guesses** based on the current game state.\n",
    "2. The environment **evaluates the guess** and returns structured feedback.\n",
    "3. The agent **updates its policy** using reward signals to improve future decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the model learns to make increasingly valid and efficient Sudoku moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by installing **TRL**, which automatically includes the main dependencies like **Transformers**.  \n",
    "We'll also install the **OpenEnv** framework (for the environment) via the HF Space we will use as environment server ([openenv/sudoku](https://huggingface.co/spaces/openenv/sudoku)), **trackio** (for logging and monitoring training runs), and **vLLM** (for efficient generation)."

    "## Create Rollout Function with Helpers\n",
    "\n",
    "The **rollout function** defines how the agent interacts with the environment during GRPO training.\n",
    "It is responsible for generating model outputs, collecting feedback (rewards), and returning all the information needed for policy optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setup:\n",
    "- The function is called automatically by the **GRPOTrainer** at each training step.\n",
    "- It uses the trainer's `generate_rollout_completions()` method for efficient generation with **vLLM** in colocate mode.\n",
    "- Each rollout represents a full interaction loop: the model makes guesses, receives feedback from the Sudoku environment, and updates its policy based on reward signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rewards track different aspects of the agent's performance, while helper functions like `rollout_once` handle a single episode of interaction, keeping the main `rollout_func` clean and modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modular approach allows GRPO to efficiently sample, evaluate, and improve the model's guessing strategy through reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define the `system_prompt` that guides the model's behavior as an expert Sudoku solver with strategic reasoning and structured responses."

    "## GAME RULES\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The puzzle is a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 subgrids (boxes)\n",
    "2. Some cells are pre-filled with numbers 1-9\n",
    "3. You must fill in the empty cells (shown as '.') with numbers 1-9\n",
    "4. Each row must contain numbers 1-9 without repetition\n",
    "5. Each column must contain numbers 1-9 without repetition\n",
    "6. Each 3x3 subgrid must contain numbers 1-9 without repetition\n",
    "7. You cannot overwrite pre-filled cells\n",
    "8. Invalid moves result in penalties (-1 reward)\n",
    "\n",
    "## RESPONSE FORMAT\n",
    "\n",
    "**CRITICAL: Output ONLY the move, nothing else. No text, no explanation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Format: [row col number]\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- [5 3 7] → places 7 in row 5, column 3\n",
    "- [1 2 4] → places 4 in row 1, column 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## STRATEGIC APPROACH\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not repeat the same move twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Strategies\n",
    "- **Naked Singles**: If a cell has only one possible candidate, fill it in immediately.\n",
    "- **Hidden Singles**: If a number can only go in one cell within a row, column, or box, place it there.\n",
    "- **Scanning**: Look at each row, column, and box to find where specific numbers can go.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intermediate Strategies\n",
    "- **Naked Pairs/Triples**: When two/three cells in a unit contain only the same candidates, eliminate those from other cells.\n",
    "- **Hidden Pairs/Triples**: When numbers only appear in specific cells within a unit, those cells can only contain those numbers.\n",
    "- **Pointing Pairs**: When a candidate in a box is restricted to a single row/column, eliminate it elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving Process\n",
    "1. Start by scanning the entire grid to identify easy fills (cells with few candidates)\n",
    "2. Look for rows, columns, or boxes with many numbers already placed\n",
    "3. Fill all naked singles first\n",
    "4. Then look for hidden singles in each row, column, and box\n",
    "5. Apply more advanced techniques as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n",
    "- Don't guess randomly - Sudoku is pure logic\n",
    "- Don't overlook any constraint (row, column, or box)\n",
    "- Don't try to overwrite pre-filled cells\n",
    "- Don't place invalid numbers (must be 1-9)\n",
    "- Don't use invalid coordinates (must be 1-9)\n",
    "- Don't repeat a move that was already made\n",
    "\n",
    "## EXAMPLES\n",

    "### Example 1: Naked Single\n",
    "If row 3, column 4 can only contain the number 5:\n",

    "### Example 2: Hidden Single\n",
    "If the number 8 can only go in one cell in row 1:\n",
