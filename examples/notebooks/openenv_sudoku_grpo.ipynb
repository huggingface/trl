        "1. Start by scanning the entire grid to identify easy fills (cells with few candidates)\n",

        "3. Fill all naked singles first\n",

        "- Don't overlook any constraint (row, column, or box)\n",
        "- Don't try to overwrite pre-filled cells\n",
        "- Don't place invalid numbers (must be 1-9)\n",
