The scaling is not perfect as it differs between neutral and the other two classes. This is something to further investigate in the future. Ideally, one would use the logit output for each class individually, but since there is no dedicated class for neutral this is a workaround."

Although this hurts performance a little this is neglectible compared to the computations of the backward passes when optimizing the model.
