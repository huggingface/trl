# Training Transformers from scratch with Soft-Q-Learning

Training transformers from scratch specifically via reinforcement learning is a challenging task. The main reason is that



# Demonstration Example
In the accompanying example, we training a transformer model from scratch with the goal of optimizing a reward so as to guide
a pretrained llm model to generate better on-topic texts.
