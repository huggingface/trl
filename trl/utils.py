    Arguments common to all scripts.

    Args:
        dataset_name (`str`):
            Dataset name.
        dataset_train_split (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"train"`):
            Dataset split to use for training.
        dataset_test_split (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"test"`):
            Dataset split to use for evaluation.
        gradient_checkpointing_use_reentrant (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to apply `use_reentrant` for gradient_checkpointing.
        ignore_bias_buffers (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Debug argument for distributed training. Fix for DDP issues with LM bias/mask buffers - invalid scalar
            type, inplace operation. See https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/22482#issuecomment-1595790992.
