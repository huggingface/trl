# TRL Completion logs

This dataset contains the completions generated during training using `trl`.

The completions are stored in parquet files, and each file contains the completions for a single step of training (depending on the `logging_steps` argument).

Each file contains the following columns:

- `step`: the step of training
- `prompt`: the prompt used to generate the completion
- `completion`: the completion generated by the model
- `reward`: the reward given to the completion by all the reward functions

Additionally, the individual reward scores are also logged using the column naming convention `reward_<reward_function_name>`. This can be used to better understand how the reward functions are working and how they interact with each other.

Having this data stored as a simple parquet file makes it easy to load and analyze using the Datasets Viewer, Polars, Pandas, etc.

You can load the dataset using the `datasets` library:

```python
import datasets

dataset = datasets.load_dataset("$log_completions_hub_repo")
```

You can also load the dataset using Polars:

```python
import polars as pl

# Login using e.g. `huggingface-cli login` to access this dataset if it's private
df = pl.read_parquet(f"hf://datasets/$log_completions_hub_repo/**/*.parquet")
```
