@dataclass
class RewardConfig(TrainingArguments):
    r"""
    Configuration class for the [`RewardTrainer`].

    Using [`~transformers.HfArgumentParser`] we can turn this class into
    [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse#module-argparse) arguments that can be specified on the
    command line.

    Parameters:
        max_length (`int` or `None`, *optional*, defaults to `1024`):
            Maximum length of the sequences (prompt + completion) in the batch. This argument is required if you want
            to use the default data collator.
        disable_dropout (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to disable dropout in the model.
        dataset_num_proc (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Number of processes to use for processing the dataset.
        center_rewards_coefficient (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Coefficient to incentivize the reward model to output mean-zero rewards (proposed by
            https://huggingface.co/papers/2312.09244, Eq. 2). Recommended value: `0.01`.
        remove_unused_columns (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to remove the columns that are not used by the model's forward pass. Can be `True` only if
            the dataset is pretokenized.
