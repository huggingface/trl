@dataclass
class RLOOConfig(TrainingArguments):
    r"""
    Configuration class for the [`RLOOTrainer`].

    This class includes only the parameters that are specific to RLOO training. For a full list of training arguments,
    please refer to the [`~transformers.TrainingArguments`] documentation. Note that default values in this class may
    differ from those in [`~transformers.TrainingArguments`].

    Using [`~transformers.HfArgumentParser`] we can turn this class into
    [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse#module-argparse) arguments that can be specified on the
    command line.

    Parameters:
        > Parameters that control the model and reference model

        model_init_kwargs (`str`, `dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
            Keyword arguments for [`~transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained`], used when the `model`
            argument of the [`RLOOTrainer`] is provided as a string.
        disable_dropout (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to disable dropout in the model. This is useful for training with a reference model, as it prevents
            the model from generating different logprobs for the same input.

        > Parameters that control the data preprocessing

        remove_unused_columns (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to only keep the column `"prompt"` in the dataset. If you use a custom reward function that
            requires any column other than `"prompts"` and `"completions"`, you should keep this to `False`.
        num_generations (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `2`):
            Number of generations per prompt to sample. The effective batch size (num_processes * per_device_batch_size
            * gradient_accumulation_steps) must be evenly divisible by this value.
        num_generations_eval (`int` or `None`, *optional*):
            Number of generations to sample during evaluation. This allows using fewer generations during evaluation to
            save computation. If `None`, uses the value of `num_generations`.
        max_completion_length (`int` or `None`, *optional*, defaults to `256`):
            Maximum length of the generated completion.
        ds3_gather_for_generation (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            This setting applies to DeepSpeed ZeRO-3. If enabled, the policy model weights are gathered for generation,
            improving generation speed. However, disabling this option allows training models that exceed the VRAM
            capacity of a single GPU, albeit at the cost of slower generation. Disabling this option is not compatible
            with vLLM generation.
        shuffle_dataset (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to shuffle the training dataset.

        > Parameters that control generation

        generation_batch_size: (`int`, *optional*):
            Batch size to use for generation. If `None`, it defaults to the effective training batch size:
            `per_device_train_batch_size * num_processes * steps_per_generation`. In other words, there is one
            generation batch processed per optimization step. Mutually exclusive with `steps_per_generation`.
        steps_per_generation: (`int`, *optional*):
            Number of steps per generation. If `None`, it defaults to `gradient_accumulation_steps`. Mutually exclusive
            with `generation_batch_size`.
        temperature (`float`, defaults to `1.0`):
            Temperature for sampling. The higher the temperature, the more random the completions.
        top_p (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `1.0`):
            Float that controls the cumulative probability of the top tokens to consider. Must be in (0, 1]. Set to
            `1.0` to consider all tokens.
        top_k (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `0`):
            Number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for top-k-filtering. If `0`, top-k-filtering is
            disabled and all tokens are considered.
        min_p (`float`, *optional*):
            Minimum token probability, which will be scaled by the probability of the most likely token. It must be a
            value between `0.0` and `1.0`. Typical values are in the `0.01-0.2` range.
        generation_kwargs (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
            Additional keyword arguments to pass to [`~transformers.GenerationConfig`] (if using transformers) or
            `SamplingParams` (if using vLLM) when sampling completions. This can be used to further customize the
            generation behavior, such as setting `suppress_tokens`, `num_beams`, etc. If it contains keys that conflict
            with the other generation parameters (like `min_p`, `top_p`, etc.), they will override them.
        chat_template_kwargs (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
            Additional keyword arguments to pass to the `apply_chat_template` function when generating completions.
        repetition_penalty (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `1.0`):
            Float that penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the prompt and the generated text so far.
            Values > `1.0` encourage the model to use new tokens, while values < `1.0` encourage the model to repeat
            tokens.
        use_transformers_paged (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to use the `transformers` paged implementation for generation. If set to `True`, the `transformers`
            paged implementation will be used for generation instead of the default padded implementation. This
            parameter is only effective when `use_vllm` is set to `False`.
        cache_implementation (`str`, *optional*):
            Implementation of the cache method for faster generation when `use_vllm` is set to `False`.

        > Parameters that control generation acceleration powered by vLLM

        use_vllm (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to use vLLM for generating completions. If set to `True`, the trainer will use vLLM for generation
            instead of the default model.generate(). Requires `vllm` to be installed.
        vllm_mode (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"server"`):
            Mode to use for vLLM integration when `use_vllm` is set to `True`. Must be one of `"server"` or
            `"colocate"`.

            - `"server"`: The trainer will send generation requests to a separate vLLM server. Make sure a TRL vLLM
              server is running (start with `trl vllm-serve`).
            - `"colocate"`: vLLM will run in the same process and share the training GPUs. This avoids the need for a
              separate server but may cause resource contention with training.
        vllm_model_impl (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"vllm"`):
            Model implementation to use for vLLM. Must be one of `"transformers"` or `"vllm"`. `"transformers"`: Use
            the `transformers` backend for model implementation. `"vllm"`: Use the `vllm` library for model
            implementation.
        vllm_structured_outputs_regex (`str`, *optional*):
            Regex for vLLM structured outputs. If `None` (default), structured outputs is disabled.

        > Parameters that control the vLLM server (only used when `vllm_mode` is `"server"`)

        vllm_server_base_url (`str`, *optional*):
            Base URL for the vLLM server (e.g., `"http://localhost:8000"`). If provided, `vllm_server_host` and
            `vllm_server_port` are ignored.
        vllm_server_host (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"0.0.0.0"`):
            Host of the vLLM server to connect to. Ignored if `vllm_server_base_url` is provided.
        vllm_server_port (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `8000`):
            Port of the vLLM server to connect to. Ignored if `vllm_server_base_url` is provided.
        vllm_server_timeout (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `240.0`):
            Total timeout duration in seconds to wait for the vLLM server to be up. If the server is not up after the
            timeout, a `ConnectionError` is raised.
        vllm_group_port (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `51216`):
            Port number for the weight update group. This is used to communicate with the vLLM server. Unless the port
            is occupied, there is no need to change it.

        > Parameters that control colocated vLLM execution (only used when `vllm_mode` is `"colocate"`)

        vllm_gpu_memory_utilization (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `0.3`):
            Control the GPU memory utilization for vLLM. This setting only applies when `vllm_mode` is set to
            `"colocate"`. If you are using `vllm_mode="server"`, this parameter must be passed separately when
            launching the vLLM server via the `--vllm_gpu_memory_utilization` flag.
        vllm_max_model_length (`int`, *optional*):
            Context window for vLLM. Set it to at least the maximum prompt length in the dataset plus
            `max_completion_length`; if omitted, it is inferred from the model config.
        vllm_tensor_parallel_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `1`):
            Control the tensor parallel size for vLLM. This setting only applies when `vllm_mode` is set to
            `"colocate"`. If you are using `vllm_mode="server"`, this parameter must be passed separately when
            launching the vLLM server via the `--vllm_tensor_parallel_size` flag.
        vllm_enable_sleep_mode (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Enable vLLM sleep mode to offload weights/cache during the optimizer step. Keeps GPU memory usage low, but
            waking the engine adds host–device transfer latency.

        > Parameters that control the training

        beta (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `0.05`):
            KL coefficient. If `0.0`, the reference model is not loaded, reducing memory usage and improving training
            speed.
        num_iterations (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `1`):
            Number of iterations per batch (denoted as μ in the algorithm).
        epsilon (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `0.2`):
            Epsilon value for clipping.
        epsilon_high (`float`, *optional*):
            Upper-bound epsilon value for clipping. If not specified, it defaults to the same value as the lower-bound
            specified in argument `epsilon`. Paper [DAPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14476) recommends `0.28`.
        reward_weights (`list[float]`, *optional*):
            Weights for each reward function. Must match the number of reward functions. If `None`, all rewards are
            weighted equally with weight `1.0`.
        normalize_advantages (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to normalize advantages. Normalization is done per generation batch to have mean `0.0` and standard
            deviation of `1.0`.
        reward_clip_range (`tuple[float, float]`, *optional*):
            Clip range for rewards as (min, max). If `None`, no clipping is applied.
        mask_truncated_completions (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            When enabled, truncated completions are excluded from the loss calculation, preventing them from being
            incorrectly penalized and introducing noise during training. According to the
            [DAPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.14476) paper, this is a good practice for training stability.
        sync_ref_model (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to synchronize the reference model with the active model every `ref_model_sync_steps` steps, using
            the `ref_model_mixup_alpha` parameter. This synchronization originates from the
            [TR-DPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2404.09656) paper.
        ref_model_mixup_alpha (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `0.6`):
            α parameter from the [TR-DPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2404.09656) paper, which controls the mix
            between the current policy and the previous reference policy during updates. The reference policy is
            updated according to the equation: `π_ref = α * π_θ + (1 - α) * π_ref_prev`. To use this parameter, you
            must set `sync_ref_model=True`.
        ref_model_sync_steps (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `512`):
            τ parameter from the [TR-DPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2404.09656) paper, which determines how
            frequently the current policy is synchronized with the reference policy. To use this parameter, you must
            set `sync_ref_model=True`.

        > Parameters that control the logging

        log_completions (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to log a sample of (prompt, completion) pairs every `logging_steps` steps. If `rich` is installed,
            it prints the sample. If `wandb` and/or `trackio` logging is enabled, it logs it to `wandb` and/or
            `trackio`.
        num_completions_to_print (`int`, *optional*):
            Number of completions to print with `rich`. If `None`, all completions are logged.
        log_unique_prompts (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to log unique prompts. If `True`, only unique prompts are logged. If `False`, all prompts are
            logged.

        > Deprecated arguments

        max_prompt_length:

            <Deprecated version="0.27.0">

            Parameter `max_prompt_length` is deprecated and will be removed in version 0.29.0. You should instead
            filter your dataset before training to ensure that prompts do not exceed your desired length.
