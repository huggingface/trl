@dataclass
class GRPOConfig(TrainingArguments):
    r"""
    Configuration class for the [`GRPOTrainer`].

    Only the parameters specific to GRPO training are listed here. For details on other parameters, refer to the
    [`~transformers.TrainingArguments`] documentation.

    Using [`~transformers.HfArgumentParser`] we can turn this class into
    [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse#module-argparse) arguments that can be specified on the
    command line.

    Parameters:
        > Parameters that control the model and reference model

        model_init_kwargs (`dict[str, Any]` or `None`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Keyword arguments for [`~transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained`], used when the `model`
            argument of the [`GRPOTrainer`] is provided as a string.

        > Parameters that control the data preprocessing

        remove_unused_columns (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to only keep the column `"prompt"` in the dataset. If you use a custom reward function that
            requires any column other than `"prompts"` and `"completions"`, you should keep this to `False`.
        max_prompt_length (`int` or `None`, *optional*, defaults to `512`):
            Maximum length of the prompt. If the prompt is longer than this value, it will be truncated left.
        num_generations (`int` or `None`, *optional*, defaults to `8`):
            Number of generations per prompt to sample.
        temperature (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `0.9`):
            Temperature for sampling. The higher the temperature, the more random the completions.
        max_completion_length (`int` or `None`, *optional*, defaults to `256`):
            Maximum length of the generated completion.

        > Parameters that control generation acceleration powered by vLLM

        use_vllm (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to use vLLM for generating completions. If set to `True`, ensure that a GPU is kept unused for
            training, as vLLM will require one for generation. vLLM must be installed (`pip install vllm`).
        vllm_device (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"auto"`):
            Device where vLLM generation will run, e.g. `"cuda:1"`. If set to `"auto"` (default), the system will
            automatically select the next available GPU after the last one used for training. This assumes that
            training has not already occupied all available GPUs.
        vllm_gpu_memory_utilization (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `0.9`):
            Ratio (between 0 and 1) of GPU memory to reserve for the model weights, activations, and KV cache on the
            device dedicated to generation powered by vLLM. Higher values will increase the KV cache size and thus
            improve the model's throughput. However, if the value is too high, it may cause out-of-memory (OOM) errors
            during initialization.
        vllm_dtype (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"auto"`):
            Data type to use for vLLM generation. If set to `"auto"`, the data type will be automatically determined
            based on the model configuration. Find the supported values in the vLLM documentation.

        > Parameters that control the training

        learning_rate (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `1e-6`):
            Initial learning rate for [`AdamW`] optimizer. The default value replaces that of
            [`~transformers.TrainingArguments`].
        per_device_train_batch_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `1`):
            Number of prompts sampled per device for training. The actual batch passed into the model will be this
            value multiplied by `num_generations`.
        gradient_accumulation_steps (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `8`):
            Number of updates steps to accumulate the gradients for, before performing a backward/update pass.
        beta (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `0.04`):
            KL coefficient.
        sync_ref_model (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to synchronize the reference model with the active model every `ref_model_sync_steps` steps, using
            the `ref_model_mixup_alpha` parameter. This synchronization originites from the
            [TR-DPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2404.09656) paper.
        ref_model_mixup_alpha (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `0.9`):
            α parameter from the [TR-DPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2404.09656) paper, which controls the mix
            between the current policy and the previous reference policy during updates. The reference policy is
            updated according to the equation: `π_ref = α * π_θ + (1 - α) * π_ref_prev`. To use this parameter, you
            must set `sync_ref_model=True`.
        ref_model_sync_steps (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `64`):
            τ parameter from the [TR-DPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2404.09656) paper, which determines how
            frequently the current policy is synchronized with the reference policy. To use this parameter, you must
            set `sync_ref_model=True`.
