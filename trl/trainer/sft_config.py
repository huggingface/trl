@dataclass
class SFTConfig(TrainingArguments):
    r"""
    Configuration class for the [`SFTTrainer`].

    This class includes only the parameters that are specific to SFT training. For a full list of training arguments,
    please refer to the [`~transformers.TrainingArguments`] documentation. Note that default values in this class may
    differ from those in [`~transformers.TrainingArguments`].

    Using [`~transformers.HfArgumentParser`] we can turn this class into
    [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse#module-argparse) arguments that can be specified on the
    command line.

    Parameters:
        > Parameters that control the model

        model_init_kwargs (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
            Keyword arguments for [`~transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained`], used when the `model`
            argument of the [`SFTTrainer`] is provided as a string. If you're training a MoE architecture and want to
            include the load balancing/auxiliary loss as a part of the final loss, remember to set
            `output_router_logits=True` in this dictionary.
        chat_template_path (`str`, *optional*):
            If specified, sets the model's chat template. This can either be the path to a tokenizer (local directory
            or Hugging Face Hub model) or a direct path to a Jinja template file. When using a Jinja file, you must
            ensure that any special tokens referenced in the template are added to the tokenizer and that the model's
            embedding layer is resized accordingly.

        > Parameters that control the data preprocessing

        dataset_text_field (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"text"`):
            Name of the column that contains text data in the dataset.
        dataset_kwargs (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
            Dictionary of optional keyword arguments for the dataset preparation. The only supported key is
            `skip_prepare_dataset`. When the model is a VLM, `skip_prepare_dataset` is automatically treated as `True`
            regardless of the provided value, since preprocessing is done on the fly.
        dataset_num_proc (`int`, *optional*):
            Number of processes to use for processing the dataset.
        eos_token (`str`, *optional*):
            Token used to indicate the end of a turn or sequence. If `None`, it defaults to
            `processing_class.eos_token`.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*):
            Token used for padding. If `None`, it defaults to `processing_class.pad_token`, or if that is also `None`,
            it falls back to `processing_class.eos_token`.
        max_length (`int` or `None`, *optional*, defaults to `1024`):
            Maximum length of the tokenized sequence. Sequences longer than `max_length` are truncated from the right.
            If `None`, no truncation is applied. When packing is enabled, this value sets the sequence length.
        shuffle_dataset (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to shuffle the dataset.
        packing (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to group multiple sequences into fixed-length blocks to improve computational efficiency and reduce
            padding. Uses `max_length` to define sequence length.
        packing_strategy (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"bfd"`):
            Strategy for packing sequences. Can be either `"bfd"` (best-fit decreasing, default), or `"wrapped"`.
        padding_free (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to perform forward passes without padding by flattening all sequences in the batch into a single
            continuous sequence. This reduces memory usage by eliminating padding overhead. Currently, this is only
            supported with the FlashAttention 2 or 3, which can efficiently handle the flattened batch structure. When
            packing is enabled with strategy `"bfd"`, padding-free is enabled, regardless of the value of this
            parameter.
        pad_to_multiple_of (`int`, *optional*):
            If set, the sequences will be padded to a multiple of this value.
        eval_packing (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether to pack the eval dataset. If `None`, uses the same value as `packing`.

        > Parameters that control the training

        completion_only_loss (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether to compute loss only on the completion part of the sequence. If set to `True`, loss is computed
            only on the completion, which is supported only for [prompt-completion](#prompt-completion) datasets. If
            `False`, loss is computed on the entire sequence. If `None` (default), the behavior depends on the dataset:
            loss is computed on the completion for [prompt-completion](#prompt-completion) datasets, and on the full
            sequence for [language modeling](#language-modeling) datasets.
        assistant_only_loss (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to compute loss only on the assistant part of the sequence. If set to `True`, loss is computed only
            on the assistant responses, which is supported only for [conversational](#conversational) datasets. If
            `False`, loss is computed on the entire sequence.
        loss_type (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"nll"`):
            Type of loss to use. Possible values are `"nll"` (negative log-likelihood, default) and `"dft"` (Dynamic
            Fine-Tuning, as described in [this paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.05629)).
        activation_offloading (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to offload the activations to the CPU.
