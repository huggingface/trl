@dataclass
class RewardConfig(TrainingArguments):
    """
    RewardConfig collects all training arguments related to the [`RewardTrainer`] class.

    Using [`HfArgumentParser`] we can turn this class into
    [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse#module-argparse) arguments that can be specified on the
    command line.

    Parameters:
        max_length (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            The maximum length of the sequences in the batch. This argument is required if you want to use the default data collator.
        gradient_checkpointing (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
                If True, use gradient checkpointing to save memory at the expense of slower backward pass.
