The tables were full but she spotted a family of four with their Manticore curled up beside them, the owner of whom was signing the receipt.\\n\\n\"Uhhh...it\\'ll be a 10 minute wait?\" the host tried.\\n\\nThe woman seemed reluctantly appeased by this and leaned against one of the awning poles to wait.\\n\\nThe family left, Manticore in tow, and the host snatched the receipt and rushed inside to get a busser on the table as soon as possible. As she squeezed past the commotion at table 5, where a mother and her many children, each with their own personal Pixie, was trying to control the havoc that the Pixies were wreaking, the manager caught the host\\'s attention.\\n\\nIn a conspiratorial voice, the manager said, \"Is that a dragon I see out there?\" The host nodded. The manager sighed and closed their eyes, pinching the bridge of their nose, as if a migraine had suddenly overtaken them. \"Did you already promise her a table?\" Another nod. \"It\\'s okay, it\\'s not your fault. You\\'re new, someone should have told you. We have a strict \\'no dragons\\' policy after the fiasco about a decade ago when someone\\'s fledgling yawned and set the awning on fire.\"\\n'"
