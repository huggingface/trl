# XPO Trainer

TRL supports the Exploratory Preference Optimization (XPO) ([Xie et al. 2024](https://huggingface.co/papers/2405.21046)) which is a simple online preference tuning method based on the DPO loss together with a reward model (RM).

XPO augments the DPO objective with an exploration bonus allowing the method to explore outside the support of the intitial model and human feedback data.

## Get started

To just run the XPO script to make sure this trainer can run, you can run the following command to train an XPO model with a dummy reward model.


```bash
python examples/scripts/xpo.py \
    --dataset_name trl-internal-testing/tldr-preference-sft-trl-style \
    --learning_rate 3e-6 \
    --output_dir models/minimal/xpo \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 1 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 64 \
    --total_episodes 30000 \
    --model_name_or_path EleutherAI/pythia-14m \
    --sft_model_path EleutherAI/pythia-14m \
    --reward_model_path EleutherAI/pythia-14m \
    --non_eos_penalty \
    --stop_token eos \
    --response_length 53 \
    --sanity_check
```
