## Overview

Exploratory Preference Optimization (XPO) was proposed in the paper [Exploratory Preference Optimization: Harnessing Implicit Q*-Approximation for Sample-Efficient RLHF](https://huggingface.co/papers/2405.21046) by Tengyang Xie, Dylan J. Foster, Akshay Krishnamurthy, [Corby Rosset](https://huggingface.co/corbyrosset), [Ahmed Awadallah](https://huggingface.co/AhmedAwadallah), and Alexander Rakhlin. It is a simple online preference tuning method based on the DPO loss together with a reward model (RM). XPO augments the DPO objective with an exploration bonus allowing the method to explore outside the support of the intitial model and human feedback data.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

> Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a central tool for language model alignment. We consider online exploration in RLHF, which exploits interactive access to human or AI feedback by deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, maximally informative responses. By allowing RLHF to confidently stray from the pre-trained model, online exploration offers the possibility of novel, potentially super-human capabilities, but its full potential as a paradigm for language model training has yet to be realized, owing to computational and statistical bottlenecks in directly adapting existing reinforcement learning techniques. We propose a new algorithm for online exploration in RLHF, Exploratory Preference Optimization (XPO), which is simple and practical -- a one-line change to (online) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023) -- yet enjoys the strongest known provable guarantees and promising empirical performance. XPO augments the DPO objective with a novel and principled exploration bonus, empowering the algorithm to explore outside the support of the initial model and human feedback data. In theory, we show that XPO is provably sample-efficient and converges to a near-optimal language model policy under natural exploration conditions, irrespective of whether the initial model has good coverage. Our analysis, which builds on the observation that DPO implicitly performs a form of Q*-approximation (or, Bellman error minimization), combines previously disparate techniques from language modeling and theoretical reinforcement learning in a serendipitous fashion through the perspective of KL-regularized Markov decision processes. Empirically, we find that XPO is more sample-efficient than non-exploratory DPO variants in a preliminary evaluation.

This post-training method was contributed by [Kashif Rasul](https://huggingface.co/kashif),  [Quentin Gallouédec](https://huggingface.co/qgallouedec) and [Lewis Tunstall](https://huggingface.co/lewtun).

## Quick start

This example demonstrates how to train a model using the XPO method. We use the [Qwen 0.5B model](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct) as the base model and the [Qwen 0.5B reward model](https://huggingface.co/trl-lib/Qwen2-0.5B-Reward) as the reward model. We use the prompts from the [UltraFeedback dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/UltraFeedback). You can view the prompts in the dataset here:

Below is the script to train the model:

```python
# train_xpo.py
from datasets import load_dataset
from trl import XPOConfig, XPOTrainer
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct")
reward_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("trl-lib/Qwen2-0.5B-Reward", num_labels=1)
train_dataset = load_dataset("trl-lib/ultrafeedback-prompt", split="train")

training_args = XPOConfig(output_dir="xpo-qwen2", logging_steps=10)
trainer = XPOTrainer(
    model=model,
    reward_model=reward_model,
    args=training_args,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
)
trainer.train()
```

Execute the script using the following command:

```bash
accelerate launch train_xpo.py
```

## Expected dataset format

XPO requires a [prompt-only dataset](dataset_formats#prompt-only). The [`XPOTrainer`] supports both [conversational](dataset_formats#conversational-dataset-format) and [standard](dataset_formats#standard-dataset-format) dataset format. When provided with a conversational dataset, the trainer will automatically apply the chat template to the dataset.

## Usage tips

### ⚠️ Use the same chat template

Make sure that the SFT model and reward model use the _same_ chat template. Otherwise, you may find the model completions are scored incorrectly during training.

### Encourage EOS token generation

We may want the model to generate completions within a given length. During training, the model will generate completions up to the maximum length specified in the `max_new_tokens` argument of [`XPOConfig`]. If you want to penalize the model for not generating an EOS token before reaching the `maximum length`, you can use the missing_eos_penalty argument of [`XPOConfig`]:

```python
training_args = XPOConfig(..., max_new_tokens=128, missing_eos_penalty=1.0)
```

### Logging Completions

To better understand your model’s behavior during training, you can log sample completions periodically using the [`LogCompletionsCallback`].

```python
trainer = XPOTrainer(..., eval_dataset=eval_dataset)
completions_callback = LogCompletionsCallback(trainer, num_prompts=8)
trainer.add_callback(completions_callback)
```

This callback logs the model's generated completions directly to Weights & Biases.

## Example script

We provide an example script to train a model using the XPO method. The script is available in [`examples/scripts/xpo.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/main/examples/scripts/xpo.py)

To test the XPO script with the [Pythia 14M model](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/pythia-14m) on the TL;DR summarization task, run the following command:

```bash
python examples/scripts/xpo.py \
    --model_name_or_path EleutherAI/pythia-14m  \
    --reward_model_path EleutherAI/pythia-14m \
    --dataset_name trl-lib/tldr \
    --learning_rate 5.0e-7 \
    --output_dir pythia-14m-tldr-xpo \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 32 \
    --num_train_epochs 3 \
    --max_new_tokens 64 \
    --warmup_ratio 0.1 \
    --missing_eos_penalty 1.0 \
    --push_to_hub
```
