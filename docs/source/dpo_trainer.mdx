## Overview

TRL supports the DPO Trainer for training language models from preference data, as described in the paper [Direct Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model](https://huggingface.co/papers/2305.18290) by [Rafael Rafailov](https://huggingface.co/rmrafailov), Archit Sharma, Eric Mitchell, [Stefano Ermon](https://huggingface.co/ermonste), [Christopher D. Manning](https://huggingface.co/manning), [Chelsea Finn](https://huggingface.co/cbfinn).

The abstract from the paper is the following:

> While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) learn broad world knowledge and some reasoning skills, achieving precise control of their behavior is difficult due to the completely unsupervised nature of their training. Existing methods for gaining such steerability collect human labels of the relative quality of model generations and fine-tune the unsupervised LM to align with these preferences, often with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is a complex and often unstable procedure, first fitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then fine-tuning the large unsupervised LM using reinforcement learning to maximize this estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model. In this paper we introduce a new parameterization of the reward model in RLHF that enables extraction of the corresponding optimal policy in closed form, allowing us to solve the standard RLHF problem with only a simple classification loss. The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant, and computationally lightweight, eliminating the need for sampling from the LM during fine-tuning or performing significant hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments show that DPO can fine-tune LMs to align with human preferences as well as or better than existing methods. Notably, fine-tuning with DPO exceeds PPO-based RLHF in ability to control sentiment of generations, and matches or improves response quality in summarization and single-turn dialogue while being substantially simpler to implement and train.

The first step is to train an SFT model, to ensure the data we train on is in-distribution for the DPO algorithm.

Then, fine-tuning a language model via DPO consists of two steps and is easier than [PPO](ppo_trainer):

1. **Data collection**: Gather a [preference dataset](dataset_formats#preference) with positive and negative selected pairs of generation, given a prompt.
2. **Optimization**: Maximize the log-likelihood of the DPO loss directly.

This process is illustrated in the sketch below (from [Figure 1 of the DPO paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2305.18290)):

Read more about DPO algorithm in the [original paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2305.18290).

## Quick start

This example demonstrates how to train a model using the DPO method. We use the [Qwen 0.5B model](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct) as the base model. We use the preference data from the [UltraFeedback dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/UltraFeedback). You can view the data in the dataset here:

Below is the script to train the model:

```python
# train_dpo.py
from datasets import load_dataset
from trl import DPOConfig, DPOTrainer
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct")
train_dataset = load_dataset("trl-lib/ultrafeedback_binarized", split="train")

training_args = DPOConfig(output_dir="Qwen2-0.5B-DPO", logging_steps=10)
trainer = DPOTrainer(model=model, args=training_args, processing_class=tokenizer, train_dataset=train_dataset)
trainer.train()
```

Execute the script using the following command:

```bash
accelerate launch train_dpo.py
```

Distributed across 8 GPUs, the training takes approximately 3 minutes. You can verify the training progress by checking the reward graph. An increasing trend in the reward margin indicates that the model is improving and generating better responses over time.

What is the best programming language?

<strong><span style="color: blue;">&lt;trl-lib/Qwen2-0.5B-DPO&gt;:</span></strong>
The best programming language for specific applications can vary depending on the use case and knowledge level of the programmer. Here are some general factors that can be used as input to choose the best programming language:

 <strong><span style="color: green;">1</span></strong> Ease of use: Some programming languages are more user-friendly than others, such as Python, Java, or Ruby. Python is popular due to its simplicity and great scalability.
 <strong><span style="color: green;">2</span></strong> Versatility: The ability to work with a wide range of data structures and frameworks can define the language as versatile.
 <strong><span style="color: green;">3</span></strong> Ease of learning: Different programming languages have different learning curves, so users must be willing to take some time to master one.
 <strong><span style="color: green;">4</span></strong> Community support: The broader community of developers and enthusiasts in the selected programming language can provide great support and resources.
 <strong><span style="color: green;">5</span></strong> Reusability: Languages that emphasize code reuse and can be easily modifiable can be more suitable for software development.

The best programming language based on these factors is subjective and depends on what the programmer intends to accomplish.

## Expected dataset type

DPO requires a [preference dataset](dataset_formats#preference). The [`DPOTrainer`] supports both [conversational](dataset_formats#conversational) and [standard](dataset_formats#standard) dataset format. When provided with a conversational dataset, the trainer will automatically apply the chat template to the dataset.

Although the [`DPOTrainer`] supports both explicit and implicit prompts, we recommend using explicit prompts. If provided with an implicit prompt dataset, the trainer will automatically extract the prompt from the `"chosen"` and `"rejected"` columns. For more information, refer to the [preference style](dataset_formats#preference) section.

### Special considerations for vision-language models

The [`DPOTrainer`] supports fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs). For these models, a vision dataset is required. To learn more about the specific format for vision datasets, refer to the [Vision dataset format](dataset_formats#vision-datasets) section.

Additionally, unlike standard text-based models where a `tokenizer` is used, for VLMs, you should replace the `tokenizer` with a `processor`.

```diff
- model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)
+ model = AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained(model_id)

- tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
+ processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)

  trainer = DPOTrainer(
      model,
      args=training_args,
      train_dataset=train_dataset,
-     processing_class=tokenizer,
+     processing_class=processor,
)
```

For a complete example of fine-tuning a vision-language model, refer to the script in [`examples/scripts/dpo_vlm.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/main/examples/scripts/dpo_vlm.py).


## Example script

We provide an example script to train a model using the DPO method. The script is available in [`trl/scripts/dpo.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/main/trl/scripts/dpo.py)

To test the DPO script with the [Qwen2 0.5B model](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct) on the [UltraFeedback dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-lib/ultrafeedback_binarized), run the following command:

```bash
accelerate launch trl/scripts/dpo.py \
    --model_name_or_path Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct \
    --dataset_name trl-lib/ultrafeedback_binarized \
    --num_train_epochs 1 \
    --logging_steps 25 \
    --output_dir Qwen2-0.5B-DPO
```

## Logged metrics

While training and evaluating we record the following reward metrics:

- `rewards/chosen`: the mean difference between the log probabilities of the policy model and the reference model for the chosen responses scaled by beta
- `rewards/rejected`: the mean difference between the log probabilities of the policy model and the reference model for the rejected responses scaled by beta
- `rewards/accuracies`: mean of how often the chosen rewards are > than the corresponding rejected rewards
- `rewards/margins`: the mean difference between the chosen and corresponding rejected rewards

## Loss functions

The DPO algorithm supports several loss functions. The loss function can be set using the `loss_type` parameter in the [`DPOConfig`]. The following loss functions are supported:

| `loss_type=`                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Like in cDPO, it assumes that the preference labels are noisy with some probability. In this approach, the `label_smoothing` parameter in the [`DPOConfig`] is used to model the probability of existing label noise. To apply this conservative loss, set `label_smoothing` to a value greater than 0.0 (between 0.0 and 0.5; the default is 0.0)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `"aot"`  or `loss_type="aot_pair"`     | The [AOT](https://huggingface.co/papers/2406.05882) authors propose to use Distributional Preference Alignment Via Optimal Transport. Traditionally, the alignment algorithms use paired preferences at a sample level, which does not ensure alignment on the distributional level. AOT, on the other hand, can align LLMs on paired or unpaired preference data by making the reward distribution of the positive samples stochastically dominant in the first order on the distribution of negative samples. Specifically, `loss_type="aot"` is appropriate for paired datasets, where each prompt has both chosen and rejected responses; `loss_type="aot_pair"` is for unpaired datasets. In a nutshell, `loss_type="aot"` ensures that the log-likelihood ratio of chosen to rejected of the aligned model has higher quantiles than that ratio for the reference model. `loss_type="aot_pair"` ensures that the chosen reward is higher on all quantiles than the rejected reward. Note that in both cases quantiles are obtained via sorting. To fully leverage the advantages of the AOT algorithm, it is important to maximize the per-GPU batch size. |
| `"apo_zero"` or `loss_type="apo_down"` | The [APO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2408.06266) method introduces an "anchored" version of the alignment objective. There are two variants: `apo_zero` and `apo_down`. The `apo_zero` loss increases the likelihood of winning outputs while decreasing the likelihood of losing outputs, making it suitable when the model is less performant than the winning outputs. On the other hand, `apo_down` decreases the likelihood of both winning and losing outputs, but with a stronger emphasis on reducing the likelihood of losing outputs. This variant is more effective when the model is better than the winning outputs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `"discopop"`                           | The [DiscoPOP](https://huggingface.co/papers/2406.08414) paper uses LLMs to discover more efficient offline preference optimization losses. In the paper the proposed DiscoPOP loss (which is a log-ratio modulated loss) outperformed other optimization losses on different tasks (IMDb positive text generation, Reddit TLDR summarization, and Alpaca Eval 2.0).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Label smoothing

The [cDPO](https://ericmitchell.ai/cdpo.pdf) is a tweak on the DPO loss where we assume that the preference labels are noisy with some probability. In this approach, the `label_smoothing` parameter in the [`DPOConfig`] is used to model the probability of existing label noise. To apply this conservative loss, set `label_smoothing` to a value greater than 0.0 (between 0.0 and 0.5; the default is 0.0).

### Syncing the reference model

The [TR-DPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2404.09656) paper suggests syncing the reference model weights after every `ref_model_sync_steps` steps of SGD with weight `ref_model_mixup_alpha` during DPO training. To toggle this callback use the `sync_ref_model=True` in the [`DPOConfig`].

### RPO loss

The [RPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2404.19733) paper implements an iterative preference tuning algorithm using a loss related to the RPO loss in this [paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2405.16436) that essentially consists of a weighted SFT loss on the chosen preferences together with the DPO loss. To use this loss, set the `rpo_alpha` in the [`DPOConfig`] to an appropriate value. The paper suggests setting this weight to `1.0`.

### WPO loss

The [WPO](https://huggingface.co/papers/2406.11827) paper adapts off-policy data to resemble on-policy data more closely by reweighting preference pairs according to their probability under the current policy. To use this method, set the `use_weighting` flag to `True` in the [`DPOConfig`].

### For Mixture of Experts Models: Enabling the auxiliary loss

MOEs are the most efficient if the load is about equally distributed between experts.  
To ensure that we train MOEs similarly during preference-tuning, it is beneficial to add the auxiliary loss from the load balancer to the final loss.

This option is enabled by setting `output_router_logits=True` in the model config (e.g. [`~transformers.MixtralConfig`]).  
To scale how much the auxiliary loss contributes to the total loss, use the hyperparameter `router_aux_loss_coef=...` (default: `0.001`) in the model config.

## Accelerate DPO fine-tuning using `unsloth`

You can further accelerate QLoRA / LoRA (2x faster, 60% less memory) using the [`unsloth`](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) library that is fully compatible with `SFTTrainer`. Currently `unsloth` supports only Llama (Yi, TinyLlama, Qwen, Deepseek etc) and Mistral architectures. Some benchmarks for DPO listed below:

| GPU      | Model     | Dataset    | 🤗   | 🤗 + Flash Attention 2 | 🦥 Unsloth | 🦥 VRAM saved |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- | --- | --------------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| A100 40G | Zephyr 7b | Ultra Chat | 1x  | 1.24x                 | **1.88x** | -11.6%       |
| Tesla T4 | Zephyr 7b | Ultra Chat | 1x  | 1.09x                 | **1.55x** | -18.6%       |

First install `unsloth` according to the [official documentation](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth). Once installed, you can incorporate unsloth into your workflow in a very simple manner; instead of loading `AutoModelForCausalLM`, you just need to load a `FastLanguageModel` as follows:

```diff
  from datasets import load_dataset
  from trl import DPOConfig, DPOTrainer
- from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
+ from unsloth import FastLanguageModel

- model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct")
- tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct")
+ model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct")
+ model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(model)
  train_dataset = load_dataset("trl-lib/ultrafeedback_binarized", split="train")

- training_args = DPOConfig(output_dir="Qwen2-0.5B-DPO", logging_steps=10)
+ training_args = DPOConfig(output_dir="Qwen2-0.5B-DPO", logging_steps=10, bf16=True)
  trainer = DPOTrainer(model=model, args=training_args, processing_class=tokenizer, train_dataset=train_dataset)
  trainer.train()

```

The saved model is fully compatible with Hugging Face's transformers library. Learn more about unsloth in their [official repository](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth).

## Reference model considerations with PEFT

You have three main options (plus several variants) for how the reference model works when using PEFT, assuming the model that you would like to further enhance with DPO was tuned using (Q)LoRA.

1. Simply create two instances of the model, each loading your adapter - works fine but is very inefficient.
2. Merge the adapter into the base model, create another adapter on top, then leave the `ref_model` param null, in which case DPOTrainer will unload the adapter for reference inference - efficient, but has potential downsides discussed below.
3. Load the adapter twice with different names, then use `set_adapter` during training to swap between the adapter being DPO'd and the reference adapter - slightly less efficient compared to 2 (~adapter size VRAM overhead), but avoids the pitfalls.

### Downsides to merging QLoRA before DPO (approach 2)

As suggested by [Benjamin Marie](https://medium.com/@bnjmn_marie/dont-merge-your-lora-adapter-into-a-4-bit-llm-65b6da287997), the best option for merging QLoRA adapters is to first dequantize the base model, then merge the adapter. Something similar to [this script](https://github.com/jondurbin/qlora/blob/main/qmerge.py).

However, after using this approach, you will have an unquantized base model. Therefore, to use QLoRA for DPO, you will need to re-quantize the merged model or use the unquantized merge (resulting in higher memory demand).

### Using option 3 - load the adapter twice

To avoid the downsides with option 2, you can load your fine-tuned adapter into the model twice, with different names, and set the model/ref adapter names in [`DPOTrainer`].

For example:

```python
# Load the base model.
bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    llm_int8_threshold=6.0,
    llm_int8_has_fp16_weight=False,
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",
)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-v0.1",
    load_in_4bit=True,
    quantization_config=bnb_config,
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
)
model.config.use_cache = False

# Load the adapter.
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(
    model,
    "/path/to/peft",
    is_trainable=True,
    adapter_name="train",
)
