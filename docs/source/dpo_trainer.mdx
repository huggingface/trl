# DPO Trainer

TRL supports the DPO Trainer for training language models from preference data, as described in the paper [Direct Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290) by Rafailov et al., 2023. For a full example have a look at  [`examples/scripts/dpo.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/main/examples/scripts/dpo.py).


The first step as always is to train your SFT model, to ensure the data we train on is in-distribution for the DPO algorithm.

## Expected dataset format

The DPO trainer expects a very specific format for the dataset. Since the model will be trained to directly optimize the preference of which sentence is the most relevant, given two sentences. We provide an example from the [`Anthropic/hh-rlhf`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf) dataset below:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-internal-testing/example-images/resolve/main/images/rlhf-antropic-example.png", width="50%">
</div>

Therefore the final dataset object should contain these 3 entries if you use the default `DPODataCollatorWithPadding` data collator. The entries should be named:

- `prompt`
- `chosen`
- `rejected`

for example:

```py
dpo_dataset_dict = {
    "prompt": [
        "hello",
        "how are you",
        "What is your name?",
        "What is your name?",
        "Which is the best programming language?",
        "Which is the best programming language?",
        "Which is the best programming language?",
    ],
    "chosen": [
        "hi nice to meet you",
        "I am fine",
        "My name is Mary",
        "My name is Mary",
        "Python",
        "Python",
        "Java",
    ],
    "rejected": [
        "leave me alone",
        "I am not fine",
        "Whats it to you?",
        "I dont have a name",
        "Javascript",
        "C++",
        "C++",
    ],
}
```

where the `prompt` contains the context inputs, `chosen` contains the corresponding chosen responses and `rejected` contains the corresponding negative (rejected) responses. As can be seen a prompt can have multiple responses and this is reflected in the entries being repeated in the dictionary's value arrays.

## Expected model format
The DPO trainer expects a model of `AutoModelForCausalLM`, compared to PPO that expects `AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead` for the value function.

## Using the `DPOTrainer`

For a detailed example have a look at the `examples/scripts/dpo.py` script. At a high level we need to initialize the `DPOTrainer` with a `model` we wish to train, a reference `ref_model` which we will use to calculate the implicit rewards of the preferred and rejected response, the `beta` refers to the hyperparameter of the implicit reward, and the dataset contains the 3 entries listed above. Note that the `model` and `ref_model` need to have the same architecture (ie decoder only or encoder-decoder).

```py
dpo_trainer = DPOTrainer(
    model,
    model_ref,
    args=training_args,
    beta=0.1,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)
```
After this one can then call:

```py
dpo_trainer.train()
```

Note that the `beta` is the temperature parameter for the DPO loss, typically something in the range of `0.1` to `0.5`. We ignore the reference model as `beta` -> 0.

## Loss functions

Given the preference data, we can fit a binary classifier according to the Bradley-Terry model and in fact the DPO authors propose the sigmoid loss on the normalized likelihood via the `logsigmoid` to fit a logistic regression.

The [RSO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06657) authors propose to use a hinge loss on the normalized likelihood from the [SLiC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10425) paper. The `DPOTrainer` can be switched to this loss via the `loss_type="hinge"` argument and the `beta` in this case is the reciprocal of the margin.

The [IPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12036) authors provide a deeper theoretical understanding of the DPO algorithms and identify an issue with overfitting and propose an alternative loss which can be used via the `loss_type="ipo"` argument to the trainer. Note that the `beta`  parameter is the reciprocal of the gap between the log-likelihood ratios of the chosen vs the rejected completion pair and thus the smaller the `beta` the larger this gaps is. As per the paper the loss is averaged over log-likelihoods of the completion (unlike DPO which is summed only).

The [cDPO](https://ericmitchell.ai/cdpo.pdf) is a tweak on the DPO loss where we assume that the preference labels are noisy with some probability that can be passed to the `DPOTrainer` via `label_smoothing` argument (between 0 and 0.5) and then a conservative DPO loss is used. Use the `loss_type="cdpo"` argument to the trainer to use it.

The [KTO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01306) authors directly maximize the utility of LLM generations instead of the log-likelihood of preferences. To use preference data with KTO, we recommend breaking up the n preferences into 2n examples and using [`KTOTrainer`](kto_trainer) (i.e., treating the data like an unpaired feedback dataset). Although it is possible to pass in `loss_type="kto_pair"` into DPOTrainer, this is a highly simplified version of KTO that we *do not recommend* in most cases. Please use [`KTOTrainer`](kto_trainer) when possible.

## Logging

While training and evaluating we record the following reward metrics:

* `rewards/chosen`: the mean difference between the log probabilities of the policy model and the reference model for the chosen responses scaled by beta
* `rewards/rejected`: the mean difference between the log probabilities of the policy model and the reference model for the rejected responses scaled by beta
* `rewards/accuracies`: mean of how often the chosen rewards are > than the corresponding rejected rewards
* `rewards/margins`: the mean difference between the chosen and corresponding rejected rewards

## Accelerate DPO fine-tuning using `unsloth`

You can further accelerate QLoRA / LoRA (2x faster, 60% less memory) using the [`unsloth`](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) library that is fully compatible with `SFTTrainer`. Currently `unsloth` supports only Llama (Yi, TinyLlama, Qwen, Deepseek etc) and Mistral architectures. Some benchmarks for DPO listed below:

|  GPU     | Model           | Dataset   | ðŸ¤—  | ðŸ¤— + Flash Attention 2 | ðŸ¦¥ Unsloth     | ðŸ¦¥ VRAM saved  |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|------|------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| A100 40G | Zephyr 7b       | Ultra Chat| 1x   | 1.24x                  | **1.88x**       | -11.6%         |
| Tesla T4 | Zephyr 7b       | Ultra Chat| 1x   | 1.09x                  | **1.55x**       | -18.6%         |

First install `unsloth` according to the [official documentation](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth). Once installed, you can incorporate unsloth into your workflow in a very simple manner; instead of loading `AutoModelForCausalLM`, you just need to load a `FastLanguageModel` as follows:

```python
import torch
from transformers import TrainingArguments
from trl import DPOTrainer
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel

max_seq_length = 2048 # Supports automatic RoPE Scaling, so choose any number.

# Load model
model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name = "unsloth/zephyr-sft",
    max_seq_length = max_seq_length,
    dtype = None, # None for auto detection. Float16 for Tesla T4, V100, Bfloat16 for Ampere+
    load_in_4bit = True, # Use 4bit quantization to reduce memory usage. Can be False.
    # token = "hf_...", # use one if using gated models like meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf
)

# Do model patching and add fast LoRA weights
model = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(
    model,
    r = 16,
    target_modules = ["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj",
                      "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj",],
    lora_alpha = 16,
    lora_dropout = 0, # Dropout = 0 is currently optimized
    bias = "none",    # Bias = "none" is currently optimized
    use_gradient_checkpointing = True,
    random_state = 3407,
)

training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="./output")

dpo_trainer = DPOTrainer(
    model,
    model_ref=None,
    args=training_args,
    beta=0.1,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)
dpo_trainer.train()
```

The saved model is fully compatible with Hugging Face's transformers library. Learn more about unsloth in their [official repository](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth).

## Reference model considerations with PEFT

You have three main options (plus several variants) for how the reference model works when using PEFT, assuming the model that you would like to further enhance with DPO was tuned using (Q)LoRA.

1. Simply create two instances of the model, each loading your adapter - works fine but is very inefficient.
2. Merge the adapter into the base model, create another adapter on top, then leave the `model_ref` param null, in which case DPOTrainer will unload the adapter for reference inference - efficient, but has potential downsides discussed below.
3. Load the adapter twice with different names, then use `set_adapter` during training to swap between the adapter being DPO'd and the reference adapter - slightly less efficient compared to 2 (~adapter size VRAM overhead), but avoids the pitfalls.

### Downsides to merging QLoRA before DPO (approach 2)

As suggested by [Benjamin Marie](https://medium.com/@bnjmn_marie/dont-merge-your-lora-adapter-into-a-4-bit-llm-65b6da287997), the best option for merging QLoRA adapters is to first dequantize the base model, then merge the adapter. Something similar to [this script](https://github.com/jondurbin/qlora/blob/main/qmerge.py).

However, after using this approach, you will have an unquantized base model. Therefore, to use QLoRA for DPO, you will need to re-quantize the merged model or use the unquantized merge (resulting in higher memory demand).

### Using option 3 - load the adapter twice

To avoid the downsides with option 2, you can load your fine-tuned adapter into the model twice, with different names, and set the model/ref adapter names in DPOTrainer.

For example:
```python
# Load the base model.
bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    llm_int8_threshold=6.0,
    llm_int8_has_fp16_weight=False,
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",
)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-v0.1",
    load_in_4bit=True,
    quantization_config=bnb_config,
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
)
model.config.use_cache = False

# Load the adapter.
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(
    model,
    "/path/to/peft",
    is_trainable=True,
    adapter_name="train",
)
# Load the adapter a second time, with a different name, which will be our reference model.
model.load_adapter("/path/to/peft", adapter_name="reference")

# Initialize the trainer, without a ref_model param.
dpo_trainer = DPOTrainer(
    model,
    ...
    model_adapter_name="train",
    ref_adapter_name="reference",
)
```
