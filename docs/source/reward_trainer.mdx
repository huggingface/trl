# Reward Modeling

TRL supports custom reward modeling for anyone to perform reward modeling on their dataset and model. 

## Expected dataset format

The reward trainer expects a very specific format for the dataset. The dataset should contain two 4 entries at least
if you don't use the default `RewardDataCollatorWithPadding` data collator. The entries should be named:

- `input_ids_j`
- `attention_mask_j`
- `input_ids_k`
- `attention_mask_k`
