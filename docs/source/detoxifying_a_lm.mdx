# Detoxifying a LM using PPO

Let us check step by step on how to detoxify a Language Model using PPO, using a dataset of toxic prompts! 
Read this section to follow our journey on how we managed to detoxify a wide range of LMs, from 125m parameters to 6B parameters! 

Here's an overview of the notebooks and scripts in the [trl repository](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/tree/main/examples/toxicity):

| File | Description | Colab link |
|---|---| --- |
| [`gpt-j-6b-toxicity.py`](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/blob/main/examples/toxicity/scripts/gpt-j-6b-toxicity.py) | Detoxify `GPT-J-6B` using PPO | x | 

## Context

A Language Model is not initially trained to be toxic, but it can be trained to be toxic by feeding it toxic prompts. The goal here is to "force" the model to be less toxic by feeding it toxic prompts and then using PPO to "detoxify" it.
We believe that if this technique would be applied to language models that are meant to be toxic (e.g. GPT-4chan) the results would be even more impressive.

### Computing toxicity scores

We used [`facebook/roberta-hate-speech-dynabench-r4-target`](https://huggingface.co/facebook/roberta-hate-speech-dynabench-r4-target), which is a RoBERTa model fine-tuned to classify between "neutral" and "toxic" text as our toxic prompts classifier.
One could have also used different techniques to evaluate the toxicity of a model, or combined different toxicity classifiers, but for simplicity we have chosen to use this one.

### Selection of models

We have decided to chose these models for our experiments to show that `trl` can be easily scaled to 10B parameters models. We have chosen to use the following models: 

* [`EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M`](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M) (125 million parameters)
* [`EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B`](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B) (2.7 billion parameters)
* [`EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B`](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) (6 billion parameters)

For the selection of the smallest model, we have chosen `EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M` because it has shown to be a model that was the "most toxic" compared to other models. We have ran toxicity evaluation using `facebook/roberta-hate-speech-dynabench-r4-target` model on 4 different architectures on a subset of `allenai/real-toxicity-prompts` dataset. Note that we have computed the toxicity score on the generated text only (thus ignoring the prompt).

| Model | Mean toxicity score |
|---|---| 
| `gpt2` | 0.01602 |
| `facebook/opt-350m` | 0.01628 |
| `bigscience/bloom-560m` | 0.00767 |
| `EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M` | **0.02016** |

## Designing the problem

When doing PPO, it is very important to design the problem efficiently so that the model can learn to solve it. Let's cover the topics that were important for the model to converge.

### Pre-processing the dataset

As we want to enhance the chance for the model to generate toxic prompts we decided to pre-process the dataset to consider only the prompt that has a toxicity score that is greater than a threshold. This can be achieved with few lines of code as shown below:
```python
ds = load_dataset("allenai/real-toxicity-prompts", split="train")

def filter_fn(sample):
    toxicity = sample["prompt"]["toxicity"]
    return toxicity is not None and toxicity > 0.3

ds = ds.filter(filter_fn, batched=False)
```

### Reward function


The reward function is one of the most important part of the PPO algorithm. It is the function that will tell the model if it is doing well or not.
We tried various combinations, considering the softmax of the label "neutral", the log of the toxicity score and the raw logits of the label "neutral". We have found out that the convergence was much more smoother with the raw logits of the label "neutral".
```python
logits = toxicity_model(**toxicity_inputs).logits.float()
toxicity_labels = (logits[:, 0]).tolist()
```

### Impact of input prompts length

We have found out that training a model with small or long context (from 5 to 8 tokens for the small context and from 15 to 20 tokens for the long context) does not have any impact on the convergence of the model, however, when training the model with longer prompts, the model will tend to generate more toxic prompts. 
We decided to use a context window of 10 to 15 tokens for the training of the larger models, as we think the results will be more impressive if the model is able to generate toxic prompts even with slightly long contexts.

### How to deal with OOM issues

Oour goal was to train models up to 6B parameters, which is about 24GB in float32! Here are few tricks we have used to be able to train the largest model on a single 40GB-RAM GPU:

- Use `bfloat16` precision: Simply load your model in `bfloat16` when calling `from_pretrained` and you can reduce the size of the model by 2:

```python
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
```

- Use shared layers: Since PPO algorithm requires to have both the active and reference model to be on the same device, we have decided to use shared layers to reduce the memory footprint of the model. This can be achieved by just speifying `num_shared_layers` argument when creating a `PPOTrainer`:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-internal-testing/example-images/resolve/main/images/trl-shared-layers.png">
</div>

```python
ppo_trainer = PPOTrainer(
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    num_shared_layers=4,
    ...
)
```

- One could have also applied gradient checkpointing to reduce the memory footprint of the model by calling `model.pretrained_model.enable_gradient_checkpointing()`.

## Training the model!

We have trained 6 models in total:

- [`ybelkada/gpt-neo-125m-detoxified-small-context`](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada/gpt-neo-125m-detoxified-small-context)
- [`ybelkada/gpt-neo-125m-detoxified-long-context`](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada/gpt-neo-125m-detoxified-long-context)
- [`ybelkada/gpt-neo-2B-detoxified-20sh-30steps`](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada/gpt-neo-2B-detoxified-20sh-30steps)
- [`ybelkada/gpt-neo-2.7B-detoxified-20shdl`](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada/gpt-neo-2.7B-detoxified-20shdl)
- [`ybelkada/gpt-j-6b-detoxified-20shdl-4mbs`](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada/gpt-j-6b-detoxified-20shdl-4mbs)
- [`ybelkada/gpt-j-6b-detoxified-1000-20shdl`](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada/gpt-j-6b-detoxified-1000-20shdl)

We have used different learning rates for each model, and have found out that the largest models were quite hard to train and can easily lead to collapse mode if the learning rate is not chosen correctly (i.e. if the learning rate is too high)

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

The final training run of `ybelkada/gpt-j-6b-detoxified-1000-20shdl` looks like the following for the largest model:

</div>

As you can see the model seems to converge quite nicely, but obviously we don't observe a very large improvement from the first step, as the original model is not trained to generate toxic contents. 

Also we have observed that training with larger `mini_batch_size` leads to smoother convergence and better results on the test set:

## Results

We tested our models on a new dataset, the `OxAISH-AL-LLM/wiki_toxic` dataset that can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OxAISH-AL-LLM/wiki_toxic). We feed to each model a toxic prompt from it (a sample with the label "toxic"), and generate 30 new tokens as it is done on the training loop and measure the toxicity score using `evaluate`'s [`toxicity` metric](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ybelkada/toxicity).
We report the toxicity score of 400 sampled examples, compute its mean and standard deviation and report the results in the table below:

| Model | Mean toxicity score | Std toxicity score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m` | 0.1627 | 0.2997 |
| `ybelkada/gpt-neo-125m-detoxified-small-context` | 0.1148 | 0.2506 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B` | 0.1884 | ,0.3178 |
| `ybelkada/gpt-neo-2.7B-detoxified-20shdl` | 0.0916 | 0.2104 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B` | 0.1699 | 0.3033 |
| `ybelkada/gpt-j-6b-detoxified-20shdl-4mbs` | 0.1510 | 0.2798 |

### Discussions

The results are quite promising, as we can see that the models are able to reduce the toxicity score of the generated text by an interesting margin. The gap is impressive for `gpt-neo-2B` model but we hoped to see a larger gap for the `gpt-j-6B` model. We believe that many tricks could solve these issues at scale, starting with training with larger `mini_batch_size` and probably allowing to back-propagate through more layers (i.e. use less shared layers).
We also think we could have trained the models on a "more toxic" dataset as the one we used is much cleaner than the dataset we used for testing our models (from our observation). 
A hypothesis we made is that larger models tends to be more toxic. Therefore, one could have also played with the KL-penalty term, to allow the model to deviate a bit more from its original distribution. We also believe that fine-tuning a model that is known to be toxic (i.e. trained on a toxic dataset) could also lead to better results.
We have also observed that training the model with larger context helps getting better results for larger models. Therefore one could have also played with this factor for the larger model and produce a better model. 

## What is next?

You can download the model and use it out of the box with `transformers`, or play with the Spaces that compares the output of the models before and after detoxification [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ybelkada/detoxified-lms).
