# Tune GPT2 to generate positive reviews
Optimise GPT2 to produce positive IMDB movie reviews using a BERT sentiment classifier as a reward function. 

Experiment setup to tune GPT2. The yellow arrows are outside the scope of this notebook, but the trained models are available through Hugging Face:

In this notebook we fine-tune GPT2 (small) to generate positive movie reviews based on the IMDB dataset. The model gets the start of a real review and is tasked to produce positive continuations. To reward positive continuations we use a BERT classifier to analyse the sentiment of the produced sentences and use the classifier's outputs as rewards signals for PPO training.

## Setup experiment

First we need to setup a few things: imports, configuration, and logger.

## Install dependencies

```bash
pip install datasets
```

### Import dependencies

```python
import torch
import wandb
import time
import os
from tqdm import tqdm
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
tqdm.pandas()

from datasets import load_dataset

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline

from trl.gpt2 import AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead
from trl.ppo import PPOTrainer
from trl.core import build_bert_batch_from_txt, listify_batch
```

### Configuration

Next we setup a few configs for the training:

```python
config = {
    "model_name": "lvwerra/gpt2-imdb",
    "cls_model_name": "lvwerra/distilbert-imdb",
    "steps": 20000,
    "batch_size": 256,
    "forward_batch_size": 16,
    "ppo_epochs": 4,   
    "txt_in_min_len": 2,
    "txt_in_max_len": 8,
    "txt_out_min_len": 4,
    "txt_out_max_len": 16,
    "lr": 1.41e-5,
    "init_kl_coef":0.2,
    "target": 6,
    "horizon":10000,
    "gamma":1,
    "lam":0.95,
    "cliprange": .2,
    "cliprange_value":.2,
    "vf_coef":.1, 
}
```

**Forward batching**: Since the models can be fairly big and we want to rollout large PPO batches this can lead to out-of-memory errors when doing the forward passes for text generation and sentiment analysis. We introduce the parameter `forward_batch_size` to split the forward passes into smaller batches. Although this hurts performance a little this is neglectible compared to the computations of the backward passes when optimizing the model. The same parameter is used in the `PPOTrainer` when doing forward passes. The `batch_size` should multiple of `forward_batch_size`.


```python
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
pipe_device = 0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else -1
```

You can see that we load a GPT2 model called `gpt2_imdb`. This model was additionally fine-tuned on the IMDB dataset for 1 epoch with the huggingface [script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/run_language_modeling.py) (no special settings). The other parameters are mostly taken from the original paper ["Fine-Tuning Language Models from Human Preferences"](
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08593.pdf). This model as well as the BERT model is available in the Huggingface model zoo [here](https://huggingface.co/models). The following code will automatically download the models.

### Initialize W&B logger
We use `wandb`to log all the metrics during training.

```python
wandb.init(name='run-42', project='gpt2-test', config=config, )
```

## Load data and models

### Load IMDB dataset
The IMDB dataset contains 50k movie review annotated with "positive"/"negative" feedback indicating the sentiment.  We load the IMDB dataset into a DataFrame and filter for comments that are at least 500 characters long and take the first 1000 characters of each comment. The first filter we apply to avoid comments that are less than `txt_in_len` token long and the second to avoid tokenizing way more text than we actually need.


```python
ds = load_dataset('imdb', split='train')
ds = ds.rename_columns({'text': 'review', 'label': 'sentiment'})
ds = ds.filter(lambda x: len(x["review"])>200, batched=False)
ds
```

```python
    Dataset({
        features: ['review', 'sentiment'],
        num_rows: 24895
    })
```


### Load BERT classifier
We load a BERT classifier fine-tuned on the IMDB dataset.


```python
sent_kwargs = {
    "return_all_scores": True,
    "function_to_apply": "none",
    "batch_size": config["forward_batch_size"]
}

sentiment_pipe = pipeline("sentiment-analysis","lvwerra/distilbert-imdb", device=pipe_device)
```

The model outputs are the logits for the negative and positive class. We will use the logits for positive class as a reward signal for the language model.


```python
text = 'this movie was really bad!!'
sentiment_pipe(text, **sent_kwargs)
```

```python
    [[{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 2.335048198699951},
      {'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': -2.726576566696167}]]
```



```python
text = 'this movie was really good!!'
sentiment_pipe(text, **sent_kwargs)
```

```python
    [[{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': -2.2947897911071777},
      {'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 2.557039737701416}]]
```

### Load pre-trained GPT2 language models

We load the GPT2 model with a value head and the tokenizer. We load the model twice; the first model is optimized while the second model serves as a reference to calculate the KL-divergence from the starting point. This serves as an additional reward signal in the PPO training to make sure the optimized model does not deviate too much from the original language model.


```python
gpt2_model = AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead.from_pretrained(config['model_name'])
gpt2_model_ref = AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead.from_pretrained(config['model_name'])

gpt2_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(config['model_name'])
gpt2_tokenizer.pad_token = gpt2_tokenizer.eos_token
```

### Watch model with wandb
This wandb magic logs the gradients and weights of the model during training.


```python
wandb.watch(gpt2_model, log='all')
```

### Move models to GPU

If `cuda` is available move the computations to the GPU.


```python
gpt2_model.to(device);
gpt2_model_ref.to(device);
```

### Tokenize IMDB reviews

We want to randomize the query and response length so we introduce a `LengthSampler` that uniformly samples values from an interval.


```python
class LengthSampler:
    def __init__(self, min_value, max_value):
        self.values = list(range(min_value, max_value))
    def __call__(self):
        return np.random.choice(self.values)
    
input_size = LengthSampler(config["txt_in_min_len"], config["txt_in_max_len"])
output_size = LengthSampler(config["txt_out_min_len"], config["txt_out_max_len"])
```

We pre-tokenize all IMDB in advance to avoid tokenizing twice. In the first step we encode the queries and slice the first `input_size()` tokens. In a second step we decode these tokens back to text for later display.


```python
def tokenize(sample):
    sample["tokens"] = gpt2_tokenizer.encode(sample["review"])[:input_size()]
    sample["query"] = gpt2_tokenizer.decode(sample["tokens"])
    return sample

ds = ds.map(tokenize, batched=False)
```

### Generation settings
For the response generation we just use sampling and make sure top-k and nucleus sampling are turned off as well as a minimal length.


```python
gen_kwargs = {
    "min_length":-1,
    "top_k": 0.0,
    "top_p": 1.0,
    "do_sample": True,
    "pad_token_id": gpt2_tokenizer.eos_token_id
}
```

## Optimize model

### Dataloader
We use a dataloader to return the batches of queries used for each PPO epoch:


```python
def collater(data):
    return dict((key, [d[key] for d in data]) for key in data[0])

dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(ds, batch_size=config['batch_size'], collate_fn=collater)
```

### Training loop

The training loop consists of the following main steps:
1. Get the query responses from the policy network (GPT-2)
2. Get sentiments for query/responses from BERT
3. Optimize policy with PPO using the (query, response, reward) triplet

**Training time**

This step takes **~2h** on a V100 GPU with the above specified settings.


```python
ppo_trainer = PPOTrainer(gpt2_model, gpt2_model_ref, gpt2_tokenizer, **config)

total_ppo_epochs = int(np.ceil(config["steps"]/config['batch_size']))

for epoch, batch in tqdm(zip(range(total_ppo_epochs), iter(dataloader))):
    logs, timing = dict(), dict()
    t0 = time.time()
    query_tensors = [torch.tensor(t).long().to(device) for t in batch["tokens"]]
    
    #### Get response from gpt2
    t = time.time()
    response_tensors = []
    for i in range(config['batch_size']):
        gen_len = output_size()
        response = gpt2_model.generate(query_tensors[i].unsqueeze(dim=0),
                                       max_new_tokens=gen_len, **gen_kwargs)
        response_tensors.append(response.squeeze()[-gen_len:])
    batch['response'] = [gpt2_tokenizer.decode(r.squeeze()) for r in response_tensors]
    timing['time/get_response'] = time.time()-t

    #### Compute sentiment score
    t = time.time()
    texts = [q + r for q,r in zip(batch['query'], batch['response'])]
    pipe_outputs = sentiment_pipe(texts, **sent_kwargs)
    rewards = torch.tensor([output[1]["score"] for output in pipe_outputs]).to(device)
    timing['time/get_sentiment_preds'] = time.time()-t
    
    #### Run PPO step 
    t = time.time()
    stats = ppo_trainer.step(query_tensors, response_tensors, rewards)
    timing['time/optimization'] = time.time()-t
     
    #### Log everything
    timing['time/epoch'] = time.time()-t0
    table_rows = [list(r) for r in zip(batch['query'], batch['response'], rewards.cpu().tolist())]
    logs.update({'game_log': wandb.Table(columns=['query', 'response', 'reward'], rows=table_rows)})
    logs.update(timing)
    logs.update(stats)
    logs['env/reward_mean'] = torch.mean(rewards).cpu().numpy()
    logs['env/reward_std'] = torch.std(rewards).cpu().numpy()
    logs['env/reward_dist'] = rewards.cpu().numpy()
    wandb.log(logs)
```

### Training progress
If you are tracking the training progress with Weights&Biases you should see a plot similar to the one below. Check out the interactive sample report on wandb.ai: [link](https://app.wandb.ai/lvwerra/trl-showcase/runs/1jtvxb1m/).

One can observe how the model starts to generate more positive outputs after a few optimisation steps.

> Note: Investigating the KL-divergence will probably show that at this point the model has not converged to the target KL-divergence, yet. To get there would require longer training or starting with a higher inital coefficient.

## Model inspection
Let's inspect some examples from the IMDB dataset. We can use `gpt2_model_ref` to compare the tuned model `gpt2_model` against the model before optimisation.


```python
#### get a batch from the dataset
bs = 16
game_data = dict()
ds.set_format("pandas")
df_batch = ds[:].sample(bs)
game_data['query'] = df_batch['query'].tolist()
query_tensors = df_batch['tokens'].tolist()

response_tensors_ref, response_tensors = [], []

#### get response from gpt2 and gpt2_ref
for i in range(bs):
    gen_len = output_size()
    output = gpt2_model_ref.generate(torch.tensor(query_tensors[i]).unsqueeze(dim=0).to(device),
                                     max_new_tokens=gen_len, **gen_kwargs).squeeze()[-gen_len:]
    response_tensors_ref.append(output)
    output = gpt2_model.generate(torch.tensor(query_tensors[i]).unsqueeze(dim=0).to(device),
                                 max_new_tokens=gen_len, **gen_kwargs).squeeze()[-gen_len:]
    response_tensors.append(output)

#### decode responses
game_data['response (before)'] = [gpt2_tokenizer.decode(response_tensors_ref[i]) for i in range(bs)]
game_data['response (after)'] = [gpt2_tokenizer.decode(response_tensors[i]) for i in range(bs)]

#### sentiment analysis of query/response pairs before/after
texts = [q + r for q,r in zip(game_data['query'], game_data['response (before)'])]
game_data['rewards (before)'] = [output[1]["score"] for output in sentiment_pipe(texts, **sent_kwargs)]

texts = [q + r for q,r in zip(game_data['query'], game_data['response (after)'])]
game_data['rewards (after)'] = [output[1]["score"] for output in sentiment_pipe(texts, **sent_kwargs)]

# store results in a dataframe
df_results = pd.DataFrame(game_data)
df_results
```


Looking at the reward mean/median of the generated sequences we observe a significant difference.


```python
print('mean:')
display(df_results[["rewards (before)", "rewards (after)"]].mean())
print()
print('median:')
display(df_results[["rewards (before)", "rewards (after)"]].median())
```

    mean:
    rewards (before)    0.156629
    rewards (after)     1.686487
    
    median:
    rewards (before)   -0.547091
    rewards (after)     2.479868


## Save model
Finally, we save the model and push it to the Hugging Face for later usage. Before we can push the model to the hub we need to make sure we logged in:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

```python
gpt2_model.save_pretrained('gpt2-imdb-pos-v2', push_to_hub=True)
gpt2_tokenizer.save_pretrained('gpt2-imdb-pos-v2', push_to_hub=True)
```
