# Sentiment Examples

The notebooks and scripts in this examples show how to fine-tune a model with a sentiment classifier (such as `lvwerra/distilbert-imdb`).

Here's an overview of the notebooks and scripts in the [trl repository](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/tree/main/examples):

| File | Description | Colab link |
|---|---| --- |
| [`gpt2-sentiment.ipynb`](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/blob/main/examples/sentiment/notebooks/gpt2-sentiment.ipynb) | Fine-tune GPT2 to generate positive movie reviews. | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lvwerra/trl/blob/main/examples/sentiment/notebooks/gpt2-sentiment.ipynb)
 |
| [`gpt2-sentiment-control.ipynb`](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/blob/main/examples/sentiment/notebooks/gpt2-sentiment-control.ipynb)  | Fine-tune GPT2 to generate movie reviews with controlled sentiment. | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lvwerra/trl/blob/main/examples/sentiment/notebooks/gpt2-sentiment-control.ipynb)
  |
| [`gpt2-sentiment.py`](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/blob/main/examples/sentiment/scripts/gpt2-sentiment.py) | Same as the notebook, but easier to use to use in mutli-GPU setup. | x | 
| [`t5-sentiment.py`](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/blob/main/examples/sentiment/scripts/t5-sentiment.py) | Same as GPT2 script, but for a Seq2Seq model (T5). | x | 


## Installation

```bash
pip install trl
#optional: wandb
pip install wandb
```

Note: if you don't want to log with `wandb` remove `log_with="wandb"` in the scripts/notebooks. You can also replace it with your favourite experiment tracker that's [supported by `accelerate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/usage_guides/tracking).


## Launch scripts

The `trl` library is powered by `accelerate`. As such it is best to configure and launch trainings with the following commands:

```bash
accelerate config # will prompt you to define the training configuration
accelerate launch scripts/gpt2-sentiment.py # launches training
```
