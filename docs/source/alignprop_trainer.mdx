# Aligning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Reward Backpropagation

## The why


If your reward function is differentiable, directly backpropagating gradients from the reward models is significantly more sample efficient than doing policy gradient algorithm like DDPO.
AlignProp does full backpropagation through time, which allows updating the earlier steps of denoising via reward backpropagation.

## Getting started with Stable Diffusion finetuning with reinforcement learning

The machinery for finetuning of Stable Diffusion models with reinforcement learning makes heavy use of HuggingFace's `diffusers`
library. A reason for  stating this is that getting started requires a bit of familiarity with the `diffusers` library concepts, mainly two of them - pipelines and schedulers.
Right out of the box (`diffusers` library), there isn't a `Pipeline` nor a `Scheduler` instance that is suitable for finetuning with reinforcement learning. Some adjustments need to made. 

There is a pipeline interface that is provided by this library that is required to be implemented to be used with the `AlignPropTrainer`, which is one of the methods for fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with reward backpropagation. **Note: Only the StableDiffusion architecture is supported at this point.**
There is a default implementation of this interface that you can use out of the box. Assuming the default implementation is sufficient and/or to get things moving, refer to the training example alongside this guide. 

The point of the interface is to fuse the pipeline and the scheduler into one object which allows for minimalness in terms of having the constraints all in one place. The interface was designed in hopes of catering to pipelines and schedulers beyond the examples in this repository and elsewhere at this time of writing. Also the scheduler step is a method of this pipeline interface and this may seem redundant given that the raw scheduler is accessible via the interface but this is one of the way to pass gradients from the scheduler step befitting of the algorithm at hand (AlignProp).

For a more detailed look into the interface and the associated default implementation, go [here](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/tree/main/trl/models/modeling_sd_base.py)

Note that the default implementation has a LoRA implementation path and a non-LoRA based implementation path. The LoRA flag enabled by default and this can be turned off by passing in the flag to do so. LORA based training is faster and the LORA associated model hyperparameters responsible for model convergence aren't as finicky as non-LORA based training.

Also in addition, there is the expectation of providing a reward function and a prompt function. The reward function is used to evaluate the generated images  and the prompt function is used to generate the prompts that are used to generate the images.

## Getting started with `examples/scripts/alignprop.py`

The `alignprop.py` script is a working example of using the `AlignProp` trainer to finetune a Stable Diffusion model. This example explicitly configures a small subset of the overall parameters associated with the config object (`AlignPropConfig`).

**Note:** one A100 GPU is recommended to get this running. For lower memory setting, consider setting truncated_backprop_rand to False. With default settings this will do truncated backpropagation with K=1.

Almost every configuration parameter has a default. There is only one commandline flag argument that is required of the user to get things up and running. The user is expected to have a [huggingface user access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) that will be used to upload the model post finetuning to HuggingFace hub. The following bash command is to be entered to get things running

```batch
python alignprop.py --hf_user_access_token <token>
```

To obtain the documentation of `stable_diffusion_tuning.py`, please run `python stable_diffusion_tuning.py --help`

The following are things to keep in mind (The code checks this for you as well) in general while configuring the trainer (beyond the use case of using the example script)

- The configurable randomized truncation range (`--alignprop_config.truncated_rand_backprop_minmax=(0,50)`) the first number should be equal and greater to 0, while the second number should equal or less to the number of diffusion timesteps (sample_num_steps)
- The configurable truncation backprop absolute step (`--alignprop_config.truncated_backprop_timestep=49`) the number should be less than the number of diffusion timesteps (sample_num_steps), it only matters when truncated_backprop_rand is set to False

## Setting up the image logging hook function

Expect the function to be given a dictionary with keys
```python
['image', 'prompt', 'prompt_metadata', 'rewards']

```
and `image`, `prompt`, `prompt_metadata`, `rewards`are batched.
You are free to log however you want the use of `wandb` or `tensorboard` is recommended.

### Key terms

- `rewards` : The rewards/score is a numerical associated with the generated image and is key to steering the RL process
- `prompt` : The prompt is the text that is used to generate the image
- `prompt_metadata` : The prompt metadata is the metadata associated with the prompt. A situation where this will not be empty is when the reward model comprises of a [`FLAVA`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flava) setup where questions and ground answers (linked to the generated image) are expected with the generated image (See here: https://github.com/kvablack/ddpo-pytorch/blob/main/ddpo_pytorch/rewards.py#L45)
- `image` : The image generated by the Stable Diffusion model

Example code for logging sampled images with `wandb` is given below.

```python
# for logging these images to wandb

def image_outputs_hook(image_data, global_step, accelerate_logger):
    # For the sake of this example, we only care about the last batch
    # hence we extract the last element of the list
    result = {}
    images, prompts, rewards = [image_data['images'],image_data['prompts'],image_data['rewards']]
    for i, image in enumerate(images):
        pil = Image.fromarray(
            (image.cpu().numpy().transpose(1, 2, 0) * 255).astype(np.uint8)
        )
        pil = pil.resize((256, 256))
        result[f"{prompts[i]:.25} | {rewards[i]:.2f}"] = [pil]
    accelerate_logger.log_images(
        result,
        step=global_step,
    )

```

### Using the finetuned model

Assuming you've done with all the epochs and have pushed up your model to the hub, you can use the finetuned model as follows

```python

import torch
from trl import DefaultDDPOStableDiffusionPipeline

pipeline = DefaultDDPOStableDiffusionPipeline("metric-space/alignprop-finetuned-sd-model")

device = torch.device("cuda") if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.device("cpu")

# memory optimization
pipeline.vae.to(device, torch.float16)
pipeline.text_encoder.to(device, torch.float16)
pipeline.unet.to(device, torch.float16)

prompts = ["squirrel", "crab", "starfish", "whale","sponge", "plankton"]
results = pipeline(prompts)

for prompt, image in zip(prompts,results.images):
    image.save(f"{prompt}.png")

```
