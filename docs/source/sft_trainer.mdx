# Supervised Fine-tuning Trainer 

Supervised fine-tuning (or SFT for short) is a crucial step in RLHF. In TRL we provide an easy-to-use API to create your SFT models and train them with few lines of code on your dataset.

Check out a complete flexible example inside [`examples/scripts`](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/tree/main/examples/scripts/sft_trainer.py) folder.

## Quickstart

If you have a dataset hosted on the ðŸ¤— Hub, you can easily fine-tune your SFT model using [`SFTTrainer`] from TRL. Let us assume your dataset is `imdb`, the text you want to predict is inside the `text` field of the dataset, and you want to fine-tune the `facebook/opt-350m` model. 
The following code-snippet takes care of all the data pre-processing and training for you:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from trl import SFTTrainer

dataset = load_dataset("imdb", split="train")

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    "facebook/opt-350m",
    train_dataset=dataset,
    dataset_text_field="text",
    max_seq_length=512,
)
trainer.train()
```
Make sure to pass a correct value for `max_seq_length` as the default value will be set to `min(tokenizer.model_max_length, 1024)`.

You can also construct a model outside of the trainer and pass it as follows:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
from datasets import load_dataset
from trl import SFTTrainer

dataset = load_dataset("imdb", split="train")

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("facebook/opt-350m")

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    dataset_text_field="text",
    max_seq_length=512,
)

trainer.train()
```

The above snippets will use the default training arguments from the [`transformers.TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments) class. If you want to modify that, make sure to create your own `TrainingArguments` object and pass it to the [`SFTTrainer`] constructor as it is done on the [`supervised_finetuning.py` script](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/blob/main/examples/stack_llama/scripts/supervised_finetuning.py) on the stack-llama example.

## Advanced usage

### Train on completions only 

You can use the `DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM` to train your model on the generated prompts only. Note that this works only in the case when `packing=False`.
To instantiate that collator for instruction data, pass a response template and the tokenizer. Here is an example of how it would work to fine-tune `opt-350m` on completions only on the CodeAlpaca dataset:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from datasets import load_dataset
from trl import SFTTrainer, DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM

dataset = load_dataset("lucasmccabe-lmi/CodeAlpaca-20k", split="train")

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("facebook/opt-350m")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/opt-350m")

def formatting_prompts_func(example):
    output_texts = []
    for i in range(len(example['instruction'])):
        text = f"### Question: {example['instruction'][i]}\n ### Answer: {example['output'][i]}"
        output_texts.append(text)
    return output_texts

response_template = " ### Answer:"
collator = DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM(response_template, tokenizer=tokenizer)

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    formatting_func=formatting_prompts_func,
    data_collator=collator,
)

trainer.train() 
```

To instantiate that collator for assistant style conversation data, pass a response template, an instruction template and the tokenizer. Here is an example of how it would work to fine-tune `opt-350m` on assistant completions only on the Open Assistant Guanaco dataset:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from datasets import load_dataset
from trl import SFTTrainer, DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM

dataset = load_dataset("timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco", split="train")

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("facebook/opt-350m")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/opt-350m")

instruction_template = "### Human:"
response_template = "### Assistant:"
collator = DataCollatorForCompletionOnlyLM(instruction_template=instruction_template, response_template=response_template, tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False)

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    dataset_text_field="text",
    data_collator=collator,
)

trainer.train() 
```

### Format your input prompts

For instruction fine-tuning, it is quite common to have two columns inside the dataset: one for the prompt & the other for the response. 
This allows people to format examples like [Stanford-Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) did as follows:
```bash
Below is an instruction ...

### Instruction
{prompt}

### Response:
{completion}
```
Let us assume your dataset has two fields, `question` and `answer`. Therefore you can just run:
```python
...
def formatting_prompts_func(example):
    output_texts = []
    for i in range(len(example['question'])):
        text = f"### Question: {example['question'][i]}\n ### Answer: {example['answer'][i]}"
        output_texts.append(text)
    return output_texts

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    formatting_func=formatting_prompts_func,
)

trainer.train()
```
To preperly format your input make sure to process all the examples by looping over them and returning a list of processed text. Check out a full example on how to use SFTTrainer on alpaca dataset [here](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/pull/444#issue-1760952763)

### Packing dataset ([`ConstantLengthDataset`])

[`SFTTrainer`] supports _example packing_, where multiple short examples are packed in the same input sequence to increase training efficiency. This is done with the [`ConstantLengthDataset`] utility class that returns constant length chunks of tokens from a stream of examples. To enable the usage of this dataset class, simply pass `packing=True` to the [`SFTTrainer`] constructor.

```python
...

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    "facebook/opt-350m",
    train_dataset=dataset,
    dataset_text_field="text",
    packing=True
)

trainer.train()
```

Note that if you use a packed dataset and if you pass `max_steps` in the training arguments you will probably train your models for more than few epochs, depending on the way you have configured the packed dataset and the training protocol. Double check that you know and understand what you are doing. 

#### Customize your prompts using packed dataset

If your dataset has several fields that you want to combine, for example if the dataset has `question` and `answer` fields and you want to combine them, you can pass a formatting function to the trainer that will take care of that. For example:

```python
def formatting_func(example):
    text = f"### Question: {example['question']}\n ### Answer: {example['answer']}"
    return text

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    "facebook/opt-350m",
    train_dataset=dataset,
    packing=True,
    formatting_func=formatting_func
)

trainer.train()
```
You can also customize the [`ConstantLengthDataset`] much more by directly passing the arguments to the [`SFTTrainer`] constructor. Please refer to that class' signature for more information.

### Control over the pretrained model

You can directly pass the kwargs of the `from_pretrained()` method to the [`SFTTrainer`]. For example, if you want to load a model in a different precision, analoguous to 

```python
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("facebook/opt-350m", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)

```python
...

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    "facebook/opt-350m",
    train_dataset=dataset,
    dataset_text_field="text",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
)

trainer.train()
```
Note that all keyword arguments of `from_pretrained()` are supported. 

### Training adapters

We also support a tight integration with ðŸ¤— PEFT library so that any user can conveniently train adapters and share them on the Hub instead of training the entire model

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from trl import SFTTrainer
from peft import LoraConfig

dataset = load_dataset("imdb", split="train")

peft_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,
    lora_alpha=32,
    lora_dropout=0.05,
    bias="none",
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM",
)

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    "EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m",
    train_dataset=dataset,
    dataset_text_field="text",
    peft_config=peft_config
)

trainer.train()
```

Note that in case of training adapters, we manually add a saving callback to automatically save the adapters only:
```python
class PeftSavingCallback(TrainerCallback):
    def on_save(self, args, state, control, **kwargs):
        checkpoint_path = os.path.join(args.output_dir, f"checkpoint-{state.global_step}")
        kwargs["model"].save_pretrained(checkpoint_path)

        if "pytorch_model.bin" in os.listdir(checkpoint_path):
            os.remove(os.path.join(checkpoint_path, "pytorch_model.bin"))
```
If you want to add more callbacks, make sure to add this one as well to properly save the adapters only during training.
```python
...

callbacks = [YourCustomCallback(), PeftSavingCallback()]

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    "EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m",
    train_dataset=dataset,
    dataset_text_field="text",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    peft_config=peft_config,
    callbacks=callbacks
)

trainer.train()
```

### Training adapters with base 8 bit models 

For that you need to first load your 8bit model outside the Trainer and pass a `PeftConfig` to the trainer. For example:

```python
...

peft_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,
    lora_alpha=32,
    lora_dropout=0.05,
    bias="none",
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM",
)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125m",
    load_in_8bit=True,
    device_map="auto",
)

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    dataset_text_field="text",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    peft_config=peft_config,
)

trainer.train()
```

## Best practices

Pay attention to the following best practices when training a model with that trainer:

- [`SFTTrainer`] always pads by default the sequences to the `max_seq_length` argument of the [`SFTTrainer`]. If none is passed, the trainer will retrieve that value from the tokenizer. Some tokenizers do not provide default value, so there is a check to retrieve the minimum between 2048 and that value. Make sure to check it before training.
- For training adapters in 8bit, you might need to tweak the arguments of the `prepare_model_for_int8_training` method from PEFT, hence we advise users to use `prepare_in_int8_kwargs` field, or create the `PeftModel` outside the [`SFTTrainer`] and pass it.
- For a more memory-efficient training using adapters, you can load the base model in 8bit, for that simply add `load_in_8bit` argument when creating the [`SFTTrainer`], or create a base model in 8bit outside the trainer and pass it.  
- If you create a model outside the trainer, make sure to not pass to the trainer any additional keyword arguments that are relative to `from_pretrained()` method.
