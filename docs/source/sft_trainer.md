## Overview

TRL supports the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Trainer for training language models.

This post-training method was contributed by [Younes Belkada](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada).

## Quick start

This example demonstrates how to train a language model using the [`SFTTrainer`] from TRL. We train a [Qwen 3 0.6B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B) model on the [Capybara dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-lib/Capybara), a compact, diverse multi-turn dataset to benchmark reasoning and generalization.

```python
from trl import SFTTrainer, SFTConfig
from datasets import load_dataset

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model="Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
    train_dataset=load_dataset("trl-lib/Capybara", split="train"),
)
trainer.train()
```

## Looking deeper into the SFT method

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is the simplest and most commonly used method to adapt a language model to a target dataset. The model is trained in a fully supervised fashion using pairs of input and output sequences. The goal is to minimize the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of the target sequence, conditioning on the input.

This section breaks down how SFT works in practice, covering the key steps: **preprocessing**, **tokenization**, **loss computation**, and **batch formatting**.

### Preprocessing and tokenization

During training, each example is expected to contain a **text field** or a **(prompt, completion)** pair, depending on the dataset format. For more details on the expected formats, see [Dataset formats](dataset_formats).
The `SFTTrainer` tokenizes each input using the model's tokenizer. If both prompt and completion are provided separately, they are concatenated before tokenization.

### Computing the loss

![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-lib/documentation-images/resolve/main/sft_figure.png)

The loss used in SFT is the **token-level cross-entropy loss**, defined as:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{SFT}}(\theta) = - \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log p_\theta(y_t \mid y_{<t}),
$$
  
where  \\( y_t \\) is the target token at timestep  \\( t \\), and the model is trained to predict the next token given the previous ones. In practice, padding tokens are masked out during loss computation.

### Label shifting and masking

During training, the loss is computed using a **one-token shift**: the model is trained to predict each token in the sequence based on all previous tokens. Specifically, the input sequence is shifted right by one position to form the target labels.
Padding tokens (if present) are ignored in the loss computation by applying an ignore index (default: `-100`) to the corresponding positions. This ensures that the loss focuses only on meaningful, non-padding tokens.


## Logged metrics

* `global_step`: The total number of optimizer steps taken so far.
* `epoch`: The current epoch number, based on dataset iteration.
* `num_tokens`: The total number of tokens processed so far.
* `loss`: The average cross-entropy loss computed over non-masked tokens in the current logging interval.
* `mean_token_accuracy`: The proportion of non-masked tokens for which the model’s top-1 prediction matches the ground truth token.
* `learning_rate`: The current learning rate, which may change dynamically if a scheduler is used.
* `grad_norm`: The L2 norm of the gradients, computed before gradient clipping.

## Customization

### Packing

[`SFTTrainer`] supports _example packing_, where multiple examples are packed in the same input sequence to increase training efficiency. To enable packing, simply pass `packing=True` to the [`SFTConfig`] constructor.

```python
training_args = SFTConfig(packing=True)
```

For more defails on packing, see [Packing](reducing_memory_usage#packing).
