# Examples of using peft and trl to finetune 8-bit models with Low Rank Adaption 

The notebooks and scripts in this examples show how to fine-tune a model with a sentiment classifier (such as `lvwerra/distilbert-imdb`).

Here's an overview of the notebooks and scripts in the [trl repository](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/tree/main/examples):

| File | Description | Colab link |
|---|---| --- |
| [`gpt2-sentiment_peft.py`](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/blob/main/examples/sentiment/scripts/gpt2-sentiment_peft.py) | Same as the sentiment analysis example, but learning a low rank adapter on a 8-bit base model |  | 
| [`cm_finetune_peft_imdb.py`](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/blob/main/examples/sentiment/scripts/gpt-neox-20b_peft/cm_finetune_peft_imdb.py) | Fine tuning a Low Rank Adapter on a frozen 8-bit model for text generation on the imdb dataset. |  | 
| [`merge_peft_adapter.py`](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/blob/main/examples/sentiment/scripts/gpt-neox-20b_peft/merge_peft_adapter.py) |  Merging of the adapter layers into the base modelâ€™s weights and storing these on the hub. |  | 
| [`gpt-neo-20b_sentiment_peft.py`](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/blob/main/examples/sentiment/scripts/gpt-neox-20b_peft/gpt-neo-20b_sentiment_peft.py) | Sentiment fine-tuning of a Low Rank Adapter to create positive reviews. |  | 
| [`gpt-neo-1b_peft.py`](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/blob/main/examples/sentiment/scripts/gpt-neo-1b-multi-gpu/gpt-neo-1b_peft.py) | Sentiment fine-tuning of a Low Rank Adapter to create positive reviews using 2 GPUs. |  | 

## Installation
Note: peft is in active development, so we install directly from their github page.
Peft also relies on the latest version of transformers. 

```bash
pip install trl[peft]
pip install bitsandbytes loralib
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git@main
#optional: wandb
pip install wandb
```

Note: if you don't want to log with `wandb` remove `log_with="wandb"` in the scripts/notebooks. You can also replace it with your favourite experiment tracker that's [supported by `accelerate`](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/usage_guides/tracking).


## Launch scripts

The `trl` library is powered by `accelerate`. As such it is best to configure and launch trainings with the following commands:

```bash
accelerate config # will prompt you to define the training configuration
accelerate launch scripts/gpt2-sentiment_peft.py # launches training
```

## Naive pipeline parallelism (NPP) for large models (>60B models)

The `trl` library also supports naive pipeline parallelism (NPP) for large models (>60B models). This is a simple way to parallelize the model across multiple GPUs. 
This paradigm, termed as "Naive Pipeline Parallelism" (NPP) is a simple way to parallelize the model across multiple GPUs. We load the model and the adapters across multiple GPUs and the activations and gradients will be naively communicated across the GPUs. This supports `int8` models as well as other `dtype` models.

### How to use NPP?

Simply load your model with a custom `device_map` argument on the `from_pretrained` to split your model across multiple devices. Check out this [nice tutorial](https://github.com/huggingface/blog/blob/main/accelerate-large-models.md) on how to properly create a `device_map` for your model. 
 
Also make sure to have the `lm_head` module on the first GPU device as it may throw an error if it is not on the first device. As this time of writing, you need to install the `main` branch of `accelerate`: `pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate.git@main` and `peft`: `pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/peft.git@main`.

That all you need to do to use NPP. Check out the [gpt-neo-1b_peft.py](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/blob/main/examples/sentiment/scripts/gpt-neo-1b-multi-gpu/gpt-neo-1b_peft.py) example for a more details usage of NPP.

### Launch scripts

Although `trl` library is powered by `accelerate`, you should run your training script in a single process. Note that we do not support Data Parallelism together with NPP yet.

```bash
python PATH_TO_SCRIPT
