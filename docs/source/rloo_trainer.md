# RLOO Trainer

TRL supports training LLMs with REINFORCE Leave-One-Out (RLOO). The idea is that instead of using a value function, RLOO generates K completions for each prompt. For each completion, RLOO uses the mean scores from the other K-1 completions as a baseline to calculate the advantage. RLOO also models the entire completion as a single action, where as PPO models each token as an action. Note that REINFORCE / A2C is a special case of PPO, when the number of PPO epochs is 1 and the number of mini-batches is 1, which is how we implement RLOO in TRL.

## Get started

To just run a RLOO script to make sure the trainer can run, you can run the following command to train a RLOO model with a dummy reward model.

```bash
python examples/scripts/rloo/rloo.py \
    --learning_rate 3e-6 \
    --output_dir models/minimal/rloo \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 64 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 1 \
    --total_episodes 10000 \
    --model_name_or_path EleutherAI/pythia-14m \
    --reward_model_path EleutherAI/pythia-14m \
    --non_eos_penalty \
```


## Explanation of the logged metrics

The logged metrics are as follows. Here is an example [tracked run at Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/huggingface/trl/runs/u2sqci34)

<!-- * `rlhf_reward_var_per_prompt`: calculated by `rlhf_reward.var(0).mean()`. This is the variance of the rewards estimated across the `args.rloo_k` samples. Usually we expect it to go down (cause policy entropy goes down). -->

* `eps`: Tracks the number of episodes per second.
* `objective/kl`: The mean Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and reference policy.
* `objective/entropy`: The mean entropy of the policy, indicating the randomness of the actions chosen by the policy.
* `objective/non_score_reward`: The mean reward from non-score-related sources, basically `beta * kl.sum(1)`, where `beta` is the KL penalty coefficient and `kl` is the per-token KL divergence.
* `objective/rlhf_reward`: The mean RLHF reward, which is `score - non_score_reward`.
* `objective/scores`: The mean scores returned by the reward model / environment.
* `policy/approxkl_avg`: The average approximate KL divergence between consecutive PPO policies. Note that this is not the same as `objective/kl`.
* `policy/clipfrac_avg`: The average fraction of policy updates that are clipped, indicating how often the policy updates are constrained to prevent large changes.
* `loss/policy_avg`: The average policy loss, indicating how well the policy is performing.
* `val/clipfrac_avg`: The average fraction of value function updates that are clipped, similar to policy/clipfrac_avg but for the value function.
* `policy/entropy_avg`: The average entropy of the policy during training, indicating how diverse the policy's actions are.
* `val/ratio`: The mean ratio of the current policy probability to the old policy probability, providing a measure of how much the policy has changed.
* `val/ratio_var`: The variance of the `val/ratio`, indicating the variability in policy changes.
* `val/num_eos_tokens`: The number of end-of-sequence (EOS) tokens generated, which can indicate the number of complete responses.
* `lr`: lr: The current learning rate used by the optimizer.
* `episode`: episode: The current global step or episode count in the training process.


## Cookbook

* Debugging TIP: `objective/rlhf_reward`: this is the ultimate objective of the RLHF training. If training works as intended, this metric should keep going up.
* Debugging TIP: `val/ratio`: this number should float around 1.0, and it gets clipped by `--cliprange 0.2` with PPO's surrogate loss. So if this `ratio` is too high like 2.0 or 1000.0 or too small like 0.1, it means the updates between consecutive policies are too drastic. You should try undertand why this is happening and try to fix it.
* Memory TIP: If you are running out of memory, you can try to reduce the `--per_device_train_batch_size` or increase the `--gradient_accumulation_steps` to reduce the memory footprint.
* Memory TIP: If you have multiple GPUs, you can also run training with DeepSpeed stage 3 to reduce the memory footprint `accelerate launch --config_file examples/accelerate_configs/deepspeed_zero3.yaml`.
* Usage TIP: We recommend to use the "EOS trick" via `--non_eos_penalty --stop_token eos`, which replaces the score of completions that do not end with an EOS token with a static scalar penalty `--penalty_reward_value`. This can help the model learn to generate more coherent completions.


## What is my model doing exactly?

To help you understand what your model is doing, we periodically log some sample completions from the model. Here is an example of a completion. In an example [tracked run at Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/huggingface/trl/runs/u2sqci34), it looks like the following, allowing you to see the model's response at different stages of training. By default we generate `--num_sample_generations 10` during training, but you can customize the number of generations.

In the logs the sampled generations look like

## Implementation details

The bulk of RLOOTrainer is based on the PPO implementation, which is based on the [The N+ Implementation Details of RLHF with PPO: A Case Study on TL;DR Summarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17031).


Below is a vectorized advantage calculation for RLOO:

```python
def test_rloo_reward():
    local_batch_size = 3
    rloo_k = 4
    # fmt: off
    rlhf_reward = torch.tensor([
        1, 2, 3, # first rlhf reward for three prompts
        2, 3, 4, # second rlhf reward for three prompts
        5, 6, 7, # third rlhf reward for three prompts
        8, 9, 10, # fourth rlhf reward for three prompts
    ]).float() # here we have 3 prompts which have 4 completions each
    # fmt: on

    baseline = (rlhf_reward.sum(0) - rlhf_reward) / (rloo_k - 1)
    advantages = torch.zeros_like(rlhf_reward)
    for i in range(0, len(advantages), local_batch_size):
        other_response_rlhf_rewards = []
        for j in range(0, len(advantages), local_batch_size):
            if i != j:
                other_response_rlhf_rewards.append(rlhf_reward[j : j + local_batch_size])
        advantages[i : i + local_batch_size] = rlhf_reward[i : i + local_batch_size] - torch.stack(
            other_response_rlhf_rewards
        ).mean(0)
    assert (1 - (2 + 5 + 8) / 3 - advantages[0].item()) < 1e-6
    assert (6 - (3 + 2 + 9) / 3 - advantages[7].item()) < 1e-6

    # vectorized impl
    rlhf_reward = rlhf_reward.reshape(rloo_k, local_batch_size)
    baseline = (rlhf_reward.sum(0) - rlhf_reward) / (rloo_k - 1)
    vec_advantages = rlhf_reward - baseline
    torch.testing.assert_close(vec_advantages.flatten(), advantages)
```

## Benchmark experiments

To validate the RLOO implementation works, we ran experiments on the 1B and 6.9B models. Here are the commands we used to run the experiments. We take the SFT / RM models directly from [The N+ Implementation Details of RLHF with PPO: A Case Study on TL;DR Summarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17031).

1B experiment can be found here:

- [🤗 Model checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/vwxyzjn/rloo_tldr)
- [🐝 Tracked experiment](https://wandb.ai/huggingface/trl/runs/u2sqci34)


To evaluate, we use vLLM to load the checkpoints and GPT3.5 as a judge model to evaluate the generated TL;DR against the reference TL;DR.
```bash
python -i examples/scripts/evals/generate_tldr.py \
    --model_name_or_path cleanrl/EleutherAI_pythia-1b-deduped__sft__tldr \
    --output_path examples/scripts/minimal/evals/sft_tldr.csv \
    --n 1000
# preferred
# response1    656
# response0    344
# Name: count, dtype: int64
python -i examples/scripts/evals/generate_tldr.py \
    --model_name_or_path vwxyzjn/rloo_tldr \
    --output_path examples/scripts/minimal/evals/rloo_tldr.csv \
    --n 1000
# preferred
# response0    532
# response1    468
# Name: count, dtype: int64
```

The RLOO checkpoint gets a 53.2% preferred rate vs the 34.4% preference rate of the SFT checkpoint. This is a good sign that the RLOO training is working as intended.

6.9B experiment is still TBD (experiments got preempted due to resource constraints).
