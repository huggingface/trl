# Command Line Interfaces (CLIs)

You can use TRL to fine-tune your Language Model on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) using the TRL CLIs.

Currently supported CLIs are:

- `trl sft`
- `trl dpo`

## Get started 

Before getting started, pick up a Language Model from Hugging Face Hub. Supported models can be found with the filter "text-generation" within models. Also make sure to pick up a relevant dataset for your task.

Also make sure to run:
```bash
accelerate config
```
and pick up the right configuration for your training setup (single / multi-GPU, DeepSpeed, etc.). Make sure to complete all steps of `accelerate config` before running any CLI command.

We also recommend you passing a YAML config file to configure your training protocol. Below is a simple example of a YAML file that you can use for training your models with `trl sft` command.

```yaml
model_name_or_path:
  HuggingFaceM4/tiny-random-LlamaForCausalLM
dataset_name:
  imdb
dataset_text_field:
  text
report_to:
  none
learning_rate:
  1e-4
lr_scheduler_type:
  cosine
```

Save that config in a `.yaml` and get directly started ! Note you can overwrite the arguments from the config file by explicitly passing them to the CLI, e.g.:

```bash
trl sft --config example_config.yaml --output_dir test-trl-cli --lr_scheduler_type cosine_with_restarts
```

Will force-use `cosine_with_restarts` for `lr_scheduler_type`.

### Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)

Follow the basic instructions above and run `trl sft --output_dir <output_dir> <*args>`: 

```bash
trl sft --config config.yaml --output_dir your-output-dir 
```

The SFT CLI is based on the `examples/scripts/sft.py` script, all arguments supported in that script should be supported by the CLI.

### Direct Policy Optimization (DPO)

First, follow the basic instructions above and run `trl dpo --output_dir <output_dir> <*args>`. Make sure to process your DPO dataset in the TRL format by using a script similar for `examples/scripts/datasets/anthropic_hh.py`


```bash
trl dpo --config config.yaml --output_dir your-output-dir 
```
