# Examples


## Introduction

The examples should work in any of the following settings (with the same script):
   - single GPU
   - multi GPUS (using PyTorch distributed mode)
   - multi GPUS (using DeepSpeed ZeRO-Offload stages 1, 2, & 3)
   - fp16 (mixed-precision), fp32 (normal precision), or bf16 (bfloat16 precision)

To run it in each of these various modes, first initialize the accelerate
configuration with `accelerate config`

**NOTE to train with a 4-bit or 8-bit model**, please run

```bash
pip install --upgrade trl[quantization]
```


## Accelerate Config
For all the examples, you'll need to generate a ðŸ¤— Accelerate config file with:

```shell
accelerate config # will prompt you to define the training configuration
```

Then, it is encouraged to launch jobs with `accelerate launch`!

We also have some other examples that are less maintained but can be used as a reference:

## Distributed training

All of the scripts can be run on multiple GPUs by providing the path of an ðŸ¤— Accelerate config file when calling `accelerate launch`. To launch one of them on one or multiple GPUs, run the following command (swapping `{NUM_GPUS}` with the number of GPUs in your machine and `--all_arguments_of_the_script` with your arguments.)

```shell
accelerate launch --config_file=examples/accelerate_configs/multi_gpu.yaml --num_processes {NUM_GPUS} path_to_script.py --all_arguments_of_the_script
```

You can also adjust the parameters of the ðŸ¤— Accelerate config file to suit your needs (e.g. training in mixed precision).

### Distributed training with DeepSpeed

Most of the scripts can be run on multiple GPUs together with DeepSpeed ZeRO-{1,2,3} for efficient sharding of the optimizer states, gradients, and model weights. To do so, run following command (swapping `{NUM_GPUS}` with the number of GPUs in your machine, `--all_arguments_of_the_script` with your arguments, and `--deepspeed_config` with the path to the DeepSpeed config file such as `examples/deepspeed_configs/deepspeed_zero1.yaml`):

```shell
accelerate launch --config_file=examples/accelerate_configs/deepspeed_zero{1,2,3}.yaml --num_processes {NUM_GPUS} path_to_script.py --all_arguments_of_the_script
```
