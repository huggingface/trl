# Trainer

At TRL we support PPO (Proximal Policy Optimisation) with an implementation that largely follows  the structure introduced in the paper "Fine-Tuning Language Models from Human Preferences" by D. Ziegler et al. [[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08593.pdf), [code](https://github.com/openai/lm-human-preferences)].
The Trainer and model classes are largely inspired from `transformers.Trainer` and `transformers.AutoModel` classes and adapted for RL.
