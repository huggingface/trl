# TRL - Transformer Reinforcement Learning

With the TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning) libray you can train transformer language models with reinforcement learning. The library is integrated with ðŸ¤— [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

TRL supports decoder models such as GPT-2, BLOOM, GPT-Neo which can all be optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). You can find installation instructions in the [installation guide](installation) and an introdcution to the library in the [Quickstart section](quickstart). There is also a more [in-depth example](sentiment_tuning) to tune GPT-2 to procude positive movie reviews.
