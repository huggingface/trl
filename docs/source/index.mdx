# TRL - Transformer Reinforcement Learning

TRL is a full stack library where we provide a set of tools to train transformer language models with Reinforcement Learning, from the Supervised Fine-tuning step (SFT), Reward Modeling step (RM) to the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) step. 
The library is integrated with 🤗 [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).
